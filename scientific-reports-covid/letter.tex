\maketitle

Here I summarize the main changes done to the Matters Arising commentary. They are all stylistic or small clarifications that do not change anything substantial in the paper.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Change in title}. I changed the title from ``Savaris et al (2021) erroneously interpreted their regressions'' to ``Pairwise difference regressions are just weighted averages,'' as recommended by the Editors.
    \item \textbf{Nonstationarity of variables}. In their response, the authors took issue with the simplifying assumption that $X^i_t, Y_t^i$ being iid. The derivations of the paper, however, remain unchanged with the weaker assumption that $\Delta X^i_t, \Delta Y_t^i$, which is closer to the assumption the authors make in their paper. So I changed it.
    \item \textbf{Formalization of mathematical derivation}. The helpful referee report stresses the important of the mathematical proof in the commentary for interpreting the original paper. Therefore, I combined the derivation into a formal statement of a proposition and its proof, highlighting the importance of the result.
\end{itemize}
