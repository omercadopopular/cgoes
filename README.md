# Research by Carlos Góes

I am an economist whose research agenda lies on the intersection between international trade and macroeconomics; I describe it as “Dynamic Trade and Spatial Macroeconomics.” I am embedding the dynamics of growth emphasized in macroeconomics into canonical trade models and incorporating the spatial dimension emphasized in trade models into macroeconomics. In my empirical work, I combine well-identified partial equilibrium effects using spatial data to inform estimates of general equilibrium effects. I use spatial data to answer questions about growth, trade, and inequality. I am an economic researcher at the World Bank Group and a Visiting Scholar at the Globalization and Prosperity Lab of UC San Diego.

Góes has a PhD in Economics (UC San Diego) and is an alumni of Johns Hopkins (MA) and of the University of Brasilia (BA).
