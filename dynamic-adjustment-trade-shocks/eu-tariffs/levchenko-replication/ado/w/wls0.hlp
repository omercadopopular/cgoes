Weighted least squares regression
---------------------------------

 ^wls0^ dvar ivars [if] [in], ^wv^ar(varlist) ^t^ype(wlstype) 
     [ ^noc^onst ^rob^ust ^hc2^ ^hc3^ ^gr^aph ]

Description
-----------

^wls0^ computes various weighted least squares regressions.  
     The command generates three variables _wls_wgt, 
     _wls_res and _wgt_res, the wls weights, the wls residuals 
     and the weighted residuals respectively.


Options
-------

^wvar(^varlist^)^ variables in the weightling equation.

^type(^wlstype^)^ the wls type.  The choices are: 
    ^abse^  - absolute value of residual
    ^e2^    - residual squared
    ^loge2^ - log residual squared
    ^xb2^   - fitted value squared

^noconst^ do not include a constant in the weighting equation.

^robust^ using robust standard errors in the final regression.

^graph^ plots the wls residuals vs fitted.


Examples
--------

 . ^wls0 exp age ownrent income incomesq, wvar(income incomesq) type(abse)^
 . ^wls0 exp age ownrent income incomesq, wvar(income incomesq) type(abse) noconst^
