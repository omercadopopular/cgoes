{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:stripplot} plots data as a series of marks against a
single magnitude axis. By default this axis is horizontal. With the
option {cmd:vertical} it is vertical.  Optionally, data points may be
jittered or stacked or cumulated into histogram- or {cmd:dotplot}-like
or distribution or quantile function displays.     Bars showing means
and confidence intervals, or boxes showing medians and quartiles, or Tufte-style quartile or midgap plots may be added. 
Reference lines showing means or other summaries of level may
also be added. 


{title:Options}

{it:General appearance}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:vertical} specifies that the magnitude axis should be
vertical. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stack} specifies that data points with identical values are to
be stacked, as in {cmd:dotplot}, except that by default there is no binning of
data.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:cumulate} specifies that data points are to be plotted with 
respect to an implicit cumulative frequency scale. 
By default displays resemble cumulative frequency plots; otherwise with 
{cmd:vertical} displays resemble quantile plots. Note that with
{cmd:cumulate} specifying {cmd:connect(L)} [sic] to join points within groups
may be helpful. 

{p 4 8 2}Given {cmd:cumulate} the further option {cmd:cumprob} specifies
use of an implicit cumulative probability scale rather than cumulative
frequency. The precise definition is to plot using (rank - 0.5) /
#values. Plotting each set of values within the same vertical or
horizontal extent permits easy superimposition over box plots. 
This coordinate is often known as the plotting position or the percentile
rank. For further statistical and bibliographic information, see Cox (2014).  

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stack} and {cmd:cumulate} may not be combined. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:height(}{it:#}{cmd:)} controls the amount of graph space
taken up by stacked data points under the {cmd:stack} or {cmd:cumulate}
options above. The default is 0.8.  This option will not by itself
change the appearance of a plot for a single variable. Note that the
height may need to be much smaller or much larger than 1 with
{cmd:over()}, given that the latter takes values literally. For example,
if your classes are 0(45)360, 36 might be a suitable height. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:centre} or {cmd:center} centres or centers markers for
each variable or group on a hidden line.

{it:Binning} 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:width(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies that values are to be rounded in
classes of specified width. Classes are defined by default by 
{cmd:round(}{it:varname}{cmd:,}{it:width}{cmd:)}. See also the 
{cmd:floor} and {cmd:ceiling} options just below. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:floor} or {cmd:ceiling} in conjunction with {cmd:width()} 
specifies rounding by {it:width} {cmd:* floor(}{it:varname/width}{cmd:)}
or {it:width} {cmd:* ceil(}{it:varname/width}{cmd:)} respectively. Only 
one may be specified. (These options are included to give some users the 
minute control they may desire, but if either option produces a marked
difference in your plot, you may be rounding too much.)  

{it:Grouping} 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:over(}{it:groupvar}{cmd:)} specifies that values of
{it:varname} are to be shown separately by groups defined by
{it:groupvar}. This option may only be specified with a single variable.
If {cmd:stack} is also specified, then note that distinct values of any
numeric {it:groupvar} are assumed to differ by at least 1. Tuning
{cmd:height()} or the prior use of {cmd:egen, group() label} will fix
any problems. See help on {help egen} if desired. 

{p 8 8 2}Note that {cmd:by()} is also available as an alternative or
complement to {cmd:over()}. See the examples for detail on how
{cmd:over()} and {cmd:by()} could be used to show data subdivided by a
cross-combination of categories. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:separate()} specifies that data points be shown separately
according to the distinct classes of the variable specified. Commonly,
but not necessarily, this option will be specified together with
{cmd:stack} or {cmd:cumulate}.  Note that this option has no effect on
any error bar or box plot or reference line calculations. 

{it:Added confidence bars or quartile boxes or Tufte-style displays}  

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:bar} specifies that bars be added showing means and
confidence intervals. Bar information is calculated using {cmd:ci}.
{cmd:bar(}{it:bar_options}{cmd:)} may be used to specify details of the
means and confidence intervals. {it:bar_options} are 

{p 8 8 2}Various options of {help ci}: 
{cmdab:l:evel()}, 
{cmdab:p:oisson}, 
{cmdab:b:inomial},   
{cmdab:exa:ct}, 
{cmdab:wa:ld}, 
{cmdab:a:gresti}, 
{cmdab:w:ilson}, 
{cmdab:j:effreys} and 
{cmdab:e:xposure()}. For example, {cmd:bar(binomial jeffreys)} specifies
those options of {cmd:ci}. 

{p 8 8 2}Users of Stata 14 up should note that {cmd:stripplot} calls up
the old syntax of {cmd:ci} under version control: see {help ci_14_0}. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:mean(}{it:scatter_options}{cmd:)} may be used to control
the rendering of the symbol for the mean. 
For example, {cmd:bar(mean(mcolor(red) ms(sh)))} specifies the use
of red small hollow squares. 

{p 8 8 2}Options of {help twoway rcap} may be used to control the 
appearance of the bar. For example, {cmd:bar(lcolor(red))} specifies
red as the bar colour. 

{p 8 8 2}These kinds of options may be combined. 

{p 8 8 2}Enthusiasts for bootstrap confidence intervals should see the 
example below showing how to calculate estimates and confidence limits 
beforehand and then use {cmd:addplot()} to show them. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:box} specifies that boxes be added showing medians and
quartiles.  Box information is calculated using {cmd:egen, median()} and
{cmd:egen, pctile()}.  {cmd:box(}{it:box_options}{cmd:)} may be used to
specify options of {help twoway rbar} to control the appearance of the
box. For example, {cmd:box(bfcolor(eltgreen))} specifies {cmd:eltgreen}
as the box fill colour.  The defaults are 
{cmd:bfcolor(none) barwidth(0.4) blwidth(medthin)}. 
Note that the length of each box is the interquartile range or IQR. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:iqr}[{cmd:(}{it:#}{cmd:)}] specifies that spikes are to be
added to boxes that extend as far as the largest or smallest value
within {it:#} IQR of the upper or lower quartile. Plain {cmd:iqr}
without argument yields a default of 1.5 for {it:#}. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:pctile(}{it:#}{cmd:)} specifies that spikes are to be
added to boxes that extend as far as the {it:#} and 100 - {it:#}
percentiles. 0 and 100 are allowed for {it:#} and are interpreted 
as the minimum and maximum values. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:whiskers()} specifies options of {help twoway rspike} that
may be used to modify the appearance of spikes added to boxes. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:iqr}, {cmd:iqr()} and {cmd:pctile()} 
have no effect without {cmd:box} or {cmd:box()}. {cmd:iqr} or
{cmd:iqr()} may not be combined with {cmd:pctile()}. 

{p 8 8 2}Given an {cmd:iqr} or {cmd:iqr()} or {cmd:pctile()} option, the
extra option {cmd:outside} specifies that values beyond the ends of the
whiskers be shown with the box plots. {cmd:outside()} may also be
specified with options of {help scatter} tuning the display of markers. 
This option is especially useful if strip or dot plots are to be
suppressed in favour of multiple box plots. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:tufte} specifies a display of median and whiskers joining  
the quartiles to the extremes. Calculations use {cmd:egen, median()}, 
{cmd:egen, min()} and {cmd:egen, max()}.  {cmd:tufte(}{it:tufte_options}{cmd:)} may be used to
specify options of {help twoway scatter} to control the appearance of the
median. For example, {cmd:tufte(mcolor(eltgreen))} specifies {cmd:eltgreen}
as the marker colour.  The defaults are {cmd:mcolor(black) ms(Dh)}. 

{p 8 8 2}{cmd:whiskers()} specifies options of {help twoway rspike} that
may be used to modify the appearance of the whiskers. 

{p 8 8 2}These displays are based on what Tufte (1983, p.124f; 2001,
p.124f; 1990a, p.62; 1990b, p.131f) and Wright and London (2009) called a {it:quartile plot} 
and Seheult (1986) and Stock and Behrens (1991) called a
{it:midgap plot}, with in each case a point symbol for the median, no
visible box, and whiskers between each quartile and the extreme beyond. See 
also Tufte (2020, p.100). 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:bar}[{cmd:()}], {cmd:box}[{cmd:()}] and {cmd:tufte}[{cmd:()}] 
may not be combined. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:boffset()} may be used to control the position of bars or
boxes or Tufte displays.  By default, 
bars are positioned 0.2 unit to the left of (or below) the base line for strips, 
Tufte displays are positioned 0.1 unit to the left of (or below) the base line for strips, 
and boxes are positioned under the 
base line for strips.  Negative arguments specify positions to the left
or below the base line and positive arguments specify positions to
the right or above. 

{it:Added reference lines} 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:refline} specifies that reference lines are to be shown 
for each group of values (each variable, subdivided by the distinct
values of any variable specified by {cmd:over()}). {cmd:refline} 
may be specified with options that tune the line width, colour,
pattern and style: see (e.g.) help for {help line options}.  
By default reference lines show means, but the option {cmd:reflevel()}
may be used to specify other summaries, so long as the name used
is that of a suitable {help egen} function. {cmd:median} is the most
obvious alternative. 

{it:Other details} 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:variablelabels} specifies that multiple variables be
labelled by their variable labels. The default is to use variable names. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:plot(}{it:plot}{cmd:)} provides a way to add other plots
to the generated graph; see help {help plot_option} (Stata 8 only). 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:addplot(}{it:plot}{cmd:)} provides a way to add other
plots to the generated graph; see help {help addplot_option} (Stata 9
up). 

{p 4 8 2}{it:graph_options} are options of {help scatter}, including
{cmd:by()}, on which see {help by_option}. Note that {cmd:by(, total)}
is not supported with bars or boxes, nor {cmd:by()} with reference lines. 
{cmd:jitter()} is often helpful. 


{title:Remarks}

{it:General and bibliographic remarks}

{p 4 4 2}Meta-remark: The very large list of references here has just
grown over several years from a much shorter set of more usual length. A
rationale for its length, beyond the amusement and bemusement of the
program author, might include: providing overwhelming evidence of how
long and how widely these plots have been invented, or re-invented;
documenting explicitly the variety of plot forms (and the variety of
plot names) in more detail than in other sources; maximising the
scope for people to find congenial references in literature accessible to
them. Equally, there is here neither intent nor claim to produce a 
comprehensive list.  

{p 4 4 2}There is not a sharp distinction in the literature or in
software implementations between {it:dot plots} and {it:strip plots}.
Commonly, but with many exceptions, a dot plot is drawn as a pointillist
analogue of a histogram. Sometimes, dot plot is used as the name when
data points are plotted in a line, or at most a narrow strip, against a
magnitude axis. Strip plot implementations, as here, usually allow
stacking options, so that dot plots may be drawn as one choice. 

{p 4 4 2}Such plots under these and yet other names go back at least as
far as Langren (1644): see Tufte (1997, p.15) and in much more detail
Friendly {it:et al.} (2010).  Galton (1869, pp.27{c -}28; 1892, 
pp.27{c -}28) gave a schematic dot diagram showing how the heights of a
million men might be plotted.  Jevons (1884), Wallace (1889), 
Bateson and Brindley (1892), Bateson (1894), Brunt (1917, 1931), Shewhart
(1931, 1939), Pearson (1931, 1938), Pearson and Chandra Sekhar (1936),
Shaw (1936), Brinton (1939), Tippett (1943) and Zipf (1949) are other
early sources.  C.B. Williams often used such diagrams in his papers (e.g. 
1940, 1944) and books (1964, 1970).

{p 4 4 2}In his now famous paper introducing the {it:Iris} data to statistical 
science, Fisher (1936) gave a histogram in which each value is represented by 
a rectangle of constant area, hence using essentially the same principle.  

{p 4 4 2}Sasieni and Royston (1996) and Wilkinson (1999a) give
general discussions: see Sasieni and Royston (1994) for the first
Stata implementation. 

{p 4 4 2}
Wilks (1948), Hald (1952) and Box {it:et al.} (1978) used the term 
{it:dot frequency diagram} or {it:dot diagram}, 
as did Rowntree (1981), Bajpai {it:et al.} (1992), Harris (1999), Armitage {it:et al.} (2002), 
Bl{c ae}sild and Granfeldt (2003), Bartholomew (2016) and Naghettini (2016).  
Monkhouse and Wilkinson (1952) used the term {it:dispersion diagram}, 
as did McGrew and Monroe (1993, 2000) and Morrocco and Ballantyne (2008); 
the term is also used for box plot-like displays 
(e.g. Hogg 1948; Ottaway 1973). 
Miller (1953, 1964) used the terms {it:dispersion graph} and 
{it:dispersion diagram}. 
Silk (1979) and Slocum {it:et al.} (2010) used the term 
{it:dispersion graph} for stacked dotplots. 
Pearson (1956) gives several examples.  
Dickinson (1963) used the term {it:dispersal graph}. 
Tukey (1974) used the term {it:dot pattern}. 
Tukey (1977, p.50) showed a dot plot for an example in which a box 
plot works poorly. See also examples in Tukey (1970a, 1970b) and 
Mosteller and Tukey (1977, p.456). 
Harris (1999) used the term {it:dot array chart}. 
Chambers {it:et al.} (1983), Becker {it: et al.} (1988), Fox (1990), 
Thompson (1992), Cleveland (1994), Lee and Tu (1997), Wilkinson (1999b, 2005)
and Reimann {it:et al.} (2008) 
used the term {it:one-dimensional scatter plot}. 
H{c a:}rdle (1991) used the term {it:needle plot}. 
Wennberg and Cooper (1996) used the term {it:distribution graph}. 
Jacoby (1997) used the term {it:univariate scatter plot}, as did 
Edwards (2000), Weissgerber {it:et al.} (2015), Kirk (2016) and
Filzmoser {it:et al.} (2018). 
Jacoby also used the term {it:unidimensional scatter plot}. 
Gerbing (2020) used the term {it:one-variable scatterplot}.
Harris (1999) used {it:one-axis} and {it:one-dimensional} terms such 
as one-axis data distribution, percentile, point and scatter graphs
and one-dimensional data distribution graphs. 
Woloshin (2000) used the term {it:turnip graphs}, attributing it to 
J.E. Wennberg. 
Ryan {it:et al.} (1985) discuss their Minitab implementation using 
the term {it:dotplot}. 
Krieg {it:et al.} (1988), Velleman (1989), Hoaglin {it:et al.} (1991), 
Gonick and Smith (1993), Swan and Sandilands (1995), Wilkinson (1999b, 2005)
Wild and Seber (2000), Burt {it:et al.} (2009), Ryan (2009), Wilcox (2009), 
Janert (2011), Cook {it:et al.} (2016), Albert (2018) and Wilks (2019) 
are among many others also using the term {it: dot plot} or {it:dotplot}. 
Yandell (2007), Thas (2010), Janert (2011), Sleeper (2018, 2020) and Wexler (2021) 
used the term {it:jittered plots} or {it:jitter plot} for jittered versions. 
Cumming (2012) used {it:dotplot} for unstacked and {it:dot histogram} 
for stacked plots. 
The latter term also appears in Wright and London (2009),  
Koponen and Hild{c e'}n (2019) and Schwabish (2021). 
McGrew {it:et al.} (2014) used {it:individual value plot} and 
{it:individual point distribution}. 
Stuetzle (1987) and Goos and Meintrup (2015) used {it:histogram}. 
Wexler {it:et al.} (2017) and Sleeper (2020) used {it:unit histogram}. 
Bradstreet (2012), Rice and Lumley (2016) and Cairo (2019) 
used {it:dot chart}.  
Cleveland (1985) used the term {it:point graph}, 
as did Harris (1999) and Slocum {it:et al.} (2010). 
Computing Resource Center (1985) and Hamilton (1992) used the terms 
{it:oneway plot} and {it:oneway scatterplot}. 
Feinstein (2002, p.67) used the term {it:one-way graph}.  
The term {it:line plot} appears in Hill and Dixon (1982), 
Cooper and Weekes (1983), Klemel{c a:} (2009) and Schuenemeyer and Drew (2011), 
that of {it:line chart} appears in Robertson (1988), 
and that of {it:linear plot} appears in Hay (1996). 
The term {it:strip plot} (or {it:strip chart}) (e.g. 
Millard 1998, 2013; Millard and Neerchal 2001; Dalgaard 2002; 
Venables and Ripley 2002; Maindonald and Braun 2003; 
Robbins 2005; Faraway 2005, 2014; Sarkar 2008; Sawitzki 2009; Thas 2010;

{p 4 4 2} 
Siegel (1988) gives an especially lucid discussion of stem-and-leaf
plots presented to maximise their resemblance to both histograms and
strip plots (in the present sense).  His first edition is preferable on
this point to the second edition, Siegel and Morgan (1996).  

{p 4 4 2}
The Federal Reserve publishes predictions of interest rates using dot plots. 
See for illustration and discussion (e.g.) the Economist (2015). 

{p 4 4 2}
Strip plot-like displays on the margins of other graphs (e.g. histograms, 
density plots, scatter plots} are now often known as {it:rugs} 
or {it:rug plots},

Tufte (1983, p.135) uses the term differently, for a series of plots linked 
together using their marginal distributions.

{p 4 4 2}Hybrid dot-box plots were used by Crowe (1933, 1936, 1971)
(on whose work see Johnston 2019),

See also Miller (1953, 1964). 

{p 4 4 2}Box plots in widely current forms are best known through the
work of Tukey (1970a, 1970b, 1972, 1977).  Various mutations were 
suggested or documented by McGill {it:et al.} (1978),  
Frigge {it:et al.} (1989), Keen (2010, 2018) and Martinez {it:et al.} (2011).  
Drawing whiskers to particular percentiles,
rather than to data points within so many IQR of the quartiles, was
emphasised by Cleveland (1985), but anticipated by Matthews (1936) 
and Grove (1956) who plotted the interoctile range, meaning between the first
and seventh octiles, as well as the range and interquartile range. 
Dury (1963), Johnson (1975), Harris (1999), Myatt (2007), 
Myatt and Johnson (2009, 2011), Davino {it:et al.} (2014), 
Chang (2013, 2019), McGrew {it:et al.} (2014), Goos and Meintrup (2015)  
and Wickham and Grolemund (2017) 
showed means as well as minimum, quartiles, median and maximum. 
Schmid (1954) showed summary graphs with median, quartiles 
and 5 and 95% points. 
Bentley (1985, 1988), Davis (2002), Spence (2007, 2014), Few (2009),  
Motulsky (2010, 2014, 2018) and Gierlinski (2016) 
plotted whiskers to 5 and 95% points. 
Crowe (1971, pp.70{c -}71) plotted median, quartiles and 10% and 90% points 
on the margins of histograms. 
Morgan and Henrion (1990, pp.221, 241), 
Fauth and Resetarits (1999), Spence (2001, p.36),  
Gotelli and Ellison (2004, 2013, pp.72, 110, 213, 416),  
Wilks (2011, p.280; 2019, p.365) and Schwabish (2021, p.198) 
plotted whiskers to 10% and 90% points, 
as was also mentioned by Ramsey and Schafer (2013, p.19). 
Harris (1999) showed examples of both 5 and 95% and 10 and 90% points. 
Altman (1991, pp.34, 63) and Greenacre (2016) plotted whiskers to 2.5% and 97.5% points. 
Reimann {it:et al.} (2008, pp.46{c -}47) plotted whiskers to 5% and 95% and 
2% and 98% points.

{p 8 8 2}A variant design was called a {it:quartile plot} by Tufte (1983,
p.124f; 2001, p.124f; 1990a, p.62; 1990b, p.131f) and Wright and London (2009)
and a {it:midgap plot} by Seheult (1986) and Stock and Behrens (1991). It
consists of a point symbol for the median, no visible box, and whiskers between
each quartile and the extreme beyond. See also Tufte (2020, p.100). 

{p 4 4 2}Parzen (1979a, 1979b, 1982) hybridised box and quantile plots as 
quantile-box plots. See also (e.g.) Shera (1991), 
Militk{c y'} and Meloun (1993), Meloun and Militk{c y'} (1994),   
Evans and Cox (2017) and Cox (2020).
Shelly (1996), Guevara and Avil{c e'} (2007) and 
Feigelson and Babu (2012, p.208) plotted quantile plots and box plots side by side.
Note, however, that the quantile box plot of Keen (2010, 2018)
is just a box plot with whiskers extending to the extremes. 
In contrast, the quantile box plots of JMP are evidently box plots with 
marks at 0.5%, 2.5%, 10%, 90%, 97.5%, 99.5%: 
see Sall {it:et al.} (2014, pp.143{c -}4).  

{p 4 4 2}
Here are some notes on variants of quantile-box plots. 
(A) The box-percentile plot of Esty and Banfield (2003) plots 
the same information differently, plotting data as
continuous lines and producing a symmetric display in which the vertical 
axis shows quantiles and the horizontal axis shows not plotting position 
{it:p}, but both {bind:min({it:p}, 1 - {it:p})} and its mirror image 
{bind:-min({it:p}, 1 - {it:p})}. Minor detail: in their paper 
plotting positions are misdescribed as "percentiles". See also 
Martinez {it:et al.} (2011, 2017), which perpetuates that confusion. 

{p 4 4 2}
The idea of plotting {bind:min({it:p}, 1 - {it:p})} (or  
its percent equivalent) appears independently in (B) "mountain plots"  
(Krouwer 1992; Monti 1995; Krouwer and Monti 1995; Goldstein 1996) 
and in (C) plots of the "flipped empirical distribution function" (Huh 1995). 
See also Xue and Titterington (2011) for a detailed analysis of 
folding a distribution function at any quantile. 
From literature seen by me, it seems that none of these threads 
-- quantile-box plots or the later variants (A) (B) (C) -- cites each other. 

{p 4 4 2}Ideas similar to box plots go back much further.  
Cox (2009) gives various
references. Bibby (1986, pp.56, 59) gave even earlier references to
their use by A.L. Bowley in his lectures about 1897 and to his
recommendation (Bowley, 1910, p.62; 1952, p.73) to use minimum and
maximum and 10, 25, 50, 75 and 90% points as a basis for graphical
summary. Range-bar plots as in Spear (1952, 1969) are often cited, but see
also the earlier work of Haemer (1948). 

{p 4 4 2}Plots showing values as deviations from means were given by
Shewhart (1931), Pearson (1956),  Davis (2002, p.81), 
Grafen and Hails (2002, pp.4{c -}7),
McKillup (2005, 2012), Klemel{c a:} (2009), 
Whitlock and Schluter (2009, pp.396, 519; 2015, p.464 and cf.p.609), 
McKillup and Dyar (2010) and Hector (2015). 
A related plot, which
seems especially popular in clinical oncology, is the waterfall plot (or
waterfall chart). Common examples show variations in change in tumour
dimensions during clinical trials.  See (e.g.) Gilder (2012). Note,
however, that waterfall plots or charts also refer to at least two quite
different plots in business and in the analysis of spectra. 

{p 4 4 2}Quantile plots were discussed by Cox (1999, 2005), including 
historical comments. Further examples long in use for environmental applications
are hypsometric curves (Clarke 1966) and flow duration curves (Searcy 1959).  

{p 4 4 2}Dot charts (also sometimes called dot plots) in the sense of
Cleveland (1984, 1994), as implemented in {help graph dot}, are quite
distinct. Various authors (e.g. Lang and Secic 2006, Zuur {it:et al.} 2007, 
Sarkar 2008, Mitchell 2010, Chang 2013/2019, Kirk 2016, Healy 2019, Gerbing 2020, Wexler 2021) 
call these Cleveland dot charts or dot plots. 
For an early variant see Snedecor (1937). 
See also (e.g.) Becker {it:et al.} (1988), Helsel and Hirsch (1992), 
Henry (1995), Jacoby (1997, 2006), Sinacore (1997),

Millard and Neerchal (2001), Heiberger and Holland (2004, 2015),

{p 4 4 2}See also Cox (2004) for a general discussion of graphing
distributions in Stata; Cox (2007) for an implementation of
stem-and-leaf plots that bears some resemblance to what is possible with
{cmd:stripplot}; and Cox (2009, 2013) on how to draw box plots using
{help twoway}. 

{it:A note for experimental design people} 

{p 4 4 2}There is no connection between {cmd:stripplot} and the strip
plots discussed in design of experiments. 

{it:A comparison between} {cmd:stripplot}{it:,} {cmd:gr7, oneway} {it:and} {cmd:dotplot}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} may have either horizontal or vertical
magnitude axis.  With {cmd:gr7, oneway} the magnitude axis is always
horizontal.  With {cmd:dotplot} the magnitude axis is always vertical. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} and {cmd:dotplot} put descriptive text on the
axes.  {cmd:gr7, oneway} puts descriptive text under each line of marks.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} and {cmd:dotplot} allow any marker symbol to be
used for the data marks.  {cmd:gr7, oneway} always shows data marks as
short vertical bars, unless {cmd:jitter()} is specified. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} and {cmd:dotplot} interpret {cmd:jitter()} in
the same way as does {cmd:scatter}.  {cmd:gr7, oneway} interprets
{cmd:jitter()} as replacing short vertical bars by sets of dots.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} and {cmd:dotplot} allow tuning of
{cmd:xlabel()}.  {cmd:gr7, oneway} does not allow such tuning: the
minimum and maximum are always shown.  Similarly, {cmd:stripplot} and
{cmd:dotplot} allow the use of {cmd:xline()} and {cmd:yline()}. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:dotplot} uses only one colour in the body of the graph.
{cmd:stripplot} allows several colours in the body of the graph with its
{cmd:separate()} option.  {cmd:gr7, oneway} uses several colours with
several variables. 

{p 4 8 2}There is no equivalent with {cmd:stripplot} or {cmd:dotplot} to
{cmd:gr7, oneway rescale}, which  stretches each set of data marks to
extend over the whole horizontal range of the graph.  Naturally, users
could standardise a bunch of variables in some way before calling
{cmd:stripplot} or {cmd:dotplot}. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} and {cmd:dotplot} with option
{cmd:over(}{it:groupvar}{cmd:)} do not require data to be sorted by
{it:groupvar}. The equivalent {cmd:gr7, oneway by(}{it:groupvar}{cmd:)}
does require this. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} allows the option {cmd:by(}{it:byvar}{cmd:)},
producing separate graph panels according to the groups of {it:byvar}.
{cmd:dotplot} does not allow the option {cmd:by()}.  {cmd:gr7, oneway}
allows the option {cmd:by(}{it:byvar}{cmd:)}, producing separate
displays within a single panel. It does not take the values of
{it:byvar} literally: displays for values 1, 2 and 4 will appear equally
spaced. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} with the {cmd:stack} option produces a variant
on {cmd:dotplot}. There is by default no binning of data: compare
{cmd:dotplot, nogroup}. Binning may be accomplished with the
{cmd:width()} option so that classes are defined by
{cmd:round(}{it:varname}{cmd:/}{it:width}) or optionally by {it:width}
{cmd:* floor(}{it:varname/width}{cmd:)} or {it:width} 
{cmd:* ceil(}{it:varname/width}{cmd:)}: contrast {cmd:dotplot, ny()}.
Conversely, stacking may in effect be suppressed in {cmd:dotplot} by
setting {cmd:nx()} sufficiently large. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stripplot} has options for showing bars as confidence intervals 
or boxes showing medians and quartiles; and for showing means, medians,
etc. by horizontal or vertical reference lines. 
{cmd:gr7, oneway box} shows Tukey-style box plots.
{cmd:dotplot} allows the showing of mean +/- SD or median and quartiles by
horizontal lines.

Philip Ender helpfully identified a bug. 
William Dupont offered encouragement. 
Kit Baum nudged me into implementing {cmd:separate()}. 
Maarten Buis made a useful suggestion about this help. 
Ron{c a'}n Conroy suggested adding whiskers. He also found two bugs. 
Marc Kaulisch asked a question which led to more emphasis on the use of {cmd:by()} and the blood pressure example.
David Airey found another bug. 
Oliver Jones asked a question which led to an example of the use of {cmd:twoway rbar} to mimic pipe or barcode symbols. 
Fredrik Norstr{c o:}m found yet another bug. 
Marcello Pagano verified the 1966 Draper and Smith reference. 
Dionyssios Mintzopoulos and Judith Abrams underlined the value of reference lines like those in {cmd:dotplot}, but drawn as such. 
Vince Wiggins and David Airey gave helpful and encouraging 
suggestions on a related program. 
Frank Harrell also made encouraging remarks. 
Alona Armstrong provided the 2015 Weissgerber {it:et al.} reference.  
James Sanders, William Lisowski, Eric Booth and Chinh Nguyen helped to  
identify and solve a problem with box line widths that were 
sometimes much too small to be visible.
David Airey found yet another bug.
