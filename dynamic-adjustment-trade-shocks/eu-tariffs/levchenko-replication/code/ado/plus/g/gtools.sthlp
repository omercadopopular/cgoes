{opt gtools} is a suite of commands that use hashes for a speedup
over traditional stata commands. Syntax is largely analogous to each
command's Stata counterparts. The following are available as part of
gtools (also see the {help gtools##examples:examples} below):

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp gcollapse R:gcollapse} and {manhelp gcontract R:gcontract} as {opt collapse} and {opt contract} replacements. {p_end}

{p_end}

{manhelp glevelsof R:glevelsof} as a {opt levelsof} replacement. {p_end}

{p 8 17 2}
{manhelp gtoplevelsof R:gtoplevelsof} ({opt gtop}): Frequency count of top levels of a {opt varlist}. {p_end}

{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt gtools} is a Stata package that provides a fast implementation of
common commands like collapse, egen, xtile, isid, levelsof, contract,
distinct, and so on using C plugins for a massive speed improvement.

{pstd}
This program helps the user manage their gtools installation. While
unnecessary in Linux or OSX, when trying to compile the plugin on Windows
it became apparent that I would need to include a DLL with the package
(in particular the DLL for the hash library). While I try to do this
automatically, I ran into enough problems while developing the plugin that I
felt compelled to include this program.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{phang}
{opt upgrade} Upgrades {opt gtools} to the latest github version.

{phang}
{opt install_latest} Alias for {opt upgrade}.

{phang}
{opt license} Prints the open source projects used in {cmd gtools}. With
{opt verbose} it also prints the licenses.

{phang}
{opt examples} (alias {opt showcase}) prints examples of how to use
various gtools functions.

{phang}
{bf:test[({it:tests})]} Run unit tests, optionally specifying which tests
to run.  Tests available are: dependencies, basic_checks, bench_test,
comparisons, switches, bench_full.  A good set of "small" tests which
take 10-20 minutes are {cmd: dependencies basic_checks bench_test}.
By default, however, the first 5 tests are run, which take 1-3h. The
bulk of that time is from {bf:comparisons}, which compares the results
from gtools to that of various native counterparts under several
different conditions. {bf:bench_full} is not run by default because this
benchmarks gtools against stata using modestly-sized data (millions).
Some stata commands are very slow under some of the benchmarks, meaning
this can take well over a day.

{phang}
{opth branch(str)} Github branch to use (defualt is master).
