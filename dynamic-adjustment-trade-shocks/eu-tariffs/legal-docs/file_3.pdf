The Joint Committee shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt  by decision the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.</p><p> 4.   (a)   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1 (iii), the Parties recognize  that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public aid  granted by Hungary shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Hungary shall be regarded as  an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92 (3) (a) of the Treaty  establishing the European Economic Community. The Joint Committee shall, taking into account the  economic situation of Hungary, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of  five years.</p><p>  (b) Each party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid, inter alia by reporting  annually to the other party on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by  providing, upon request, information on aid schemes.
