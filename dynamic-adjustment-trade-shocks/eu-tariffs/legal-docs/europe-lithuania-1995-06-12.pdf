These measures must not exceed the scope of what is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have arisen;</p><p>(b) as regards Article 29, the Association Council shall be informed of the dumping case as soon as the authorities of the importing Party have initiated an investigation.

The Association Council shall by decision adopt the appropriate provisions to implement the objective set out in Article 38.</p><p>2.

Taking into account the labour market situation in the Member State, subject to its legislation and to the respect of rules in force in that Member State in the area of mobility of workers,</p><p>- the existing facilities for access to employment for Lithuanian workers accorded by Member States under bilateral agreements ought to be preserved and if possible improved,</p><p>- the other Member States shall consider favourably the possibility of concluding similar agreements.</p><p>2.

The Community and its Member States shall grant, except for the sectors included in Annex XVI, from entry into force of this Agreement:</p><p>(i) treatment no less favourable than that accorded by Member States to their own companies or to any third country company, whichever is the better, with regard to the establishment of Lithuanian companies;</p><p>(ii) to subsidiaries and branches of Lithuanian companies, established in their territory, treatment no less favourable than that accorded by Member States to their own companies and branches or to subsidiaries and branches of any third country company established in their territory, whichever is the better, in respect of their operation.</p><p>2. Lithuania shall facilitate the setting up of operations on its territory by Community companies and nationals. To that end, it shall, except for the sectors included in Annex XVIIa:</p><p>(i) grant, from entry into force of the Agreement, for the establishment of Community companies, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies or to companies of any third country, whichever is the better, save for the sectors referred to in Annex XVIIb, where national treatment shall be granted at the latest by the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3;</p><p>(ii) grant, from entry into force of this Agreement, for the operation of branches and subsidiaries of Community companies, established in Lithuania, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own companies or to subsidiaries and branches of any third country company established in its territory, whichever is the better.</p><p>3. Lithuania shall, during the transitional period referred to in paragraph 2 (i) not adopt any measures or actions which introduce discrimination as regards the establishment and operations of Community companies and nationals in its territory in comparison with its own companies and nationals.</p><p>4. The Association Council shall examine regularly the possibility of accelerating the granting of national treatment in the sectors referred to in Annex XVIIb and the inclusion of areas or matters listed in Annex XVIIa within the scope of application of paragraph 2 of this Article. Amendments may be made to these Annexes by decision of the Association Council.</p><p>Following the expiration of the transitional period referred to in Article 3, the Association Council may exceptionally, on request of Lithuania, and if the necessity arises, decide to prolong the duration of exclusion of certain areas or matters listed in Annex XVIIb for a limited period of time.</p><p>5. The treatment described in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applicable for the establishment and operation of nationals as from the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3.</p><p>6.

The provisions of Article 44 shall not apply to air transport, inland waterways and maritime cabotage transport services.</p><p>2. The Association Council may make recommendations for improving establishment and operations in the areas covered by paragraph 1.</p><p></p><p>Article 46</p><p>For the purposes of this Agreement:</p><p>(a) a &#039;Community company` or a &#039;Lithuanian company` respectively shall mean a company set up in accordance with the laws of a Member State or of Lithuania respectively and having its registered office or central administration or principal place of business within the Community or in the territory of Lithuania respectively.</p><p>However, should the company, set up in accordance with the laws of a Member State or Lithuania respectively, have only its registered office within the Community or in the territory of Lithuania respectively, the company shall be considered a Community or Lithuanian company respectively if its operations possess a real and continuous link with the economy of one of the Member States or Lithuania respectively;</p><p>(b) &#039;subsidiary` of a company shall mean a company which is effectively controlled by the first company,</p><p>(c) &#039;branch` of a company shall mean a place of business not having legal personality which has the appearance of permanency, such as the extension of a parent body, has a management and is materially equipped to negotiate business with third parties so that the latter, although knowing that there will, if necessary, be a legal link with the parent body, the head office of which is abroad, do not have to deal directly with such parent body but may transact business at the place of business constituting the extension.</p><p>(d) &#039;establishment` shall mean:</p><p>(i) as regards nationals, the right to take up economic activities as self-employed persons and to set up undertakings, in particular companies, which they effectively control. Self-employment and business undertakings by nationals shall not extend to seeking or taking employment in the labour market or confer a right of access to the labour market of another Party. The provisions of this Chapter do not apply to those who are not exclusively self-employed;</p><p>(ii) as regards Community or Lithuanian companies, the right to take up economic activities by means of the setting up of subsidiaries and branches in Lithuania or in the Community respectively;</p><p>(e) &#039;operation` shall mean the pursuit of economic activities;</p><p>(f) &#039;economic activities` shall in principle include activities of an industrial, commercial and professional character and activities of craftsmen;</p><p>(g) &#039;Community national` and &#039;Lithuanian national` shall mean respectively a natural person who is a national of one of the Member States or of Lithuania;</p><p>(h) with regard to international maritime transport, including intermodal operations involving a sea leg, nationals of the Member States or of Lithuania established outside the Community or Lithuania respectively, and shipping companies established outside the Community or Lithuania and controlled by nationals of a Member State or Lithuanian nationals respectively, shall also be beneficiaries of the provisions of Chapter II and Chapter III, if their vessels are registered in that Member State or in Lithuania respectively in accordance with their respective legislation.</p><p></p><p>Article 47</p><p>1. Subject to the provisions of Article 44, with the exception of financial services described in Annex XVIII, each Party may regulate the establishment and operation of companies and nationals on its territory, in so far as these regulations do not discriminate against companies and nationals of the other Party in comparison with its own companies and nationals.</p><p>2. In respect of financial services, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, a Party shall not be prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policyholders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. Such measures shall not be used as a means of avoiding the Party&#039;s obligations under the Agreement.</p><p>3. Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to disclose information relating to the affairs and accounts of individual customers or any confidential or proprietary information in the possession of public entities.</p><p></p><p>Article 48</p><p>1. The provisions of Articles 44 and 47 do not preclude the application by a Party of particular rules concerning the establishment and operation in its territory of branches of companies of another Party not incorporated in the territory of the first Party, which are justified by legal or technical differences between such branches as compared with branches of companies incorporated in its territory or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.</p><p>2. The difference in treatment shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary as a result of such legal or technical differences or, as regards financial services, for prudential reasons.</p><p></p><p>Article 49</p><p>1. A &#039;Community company` or a &#039;Lithuanian company` established in the territory of Lithuania or the Community respectively shall be entitled to employ, or have employed by one of its subsidiaries or branches, in accordance with the legislation in force in the host country of establishment, in the territory of Lithuania and the Community respectively, employees who are nationals of Community Member States and Lithuania respectively, provided that such employees are key personnel as defined in paragraph 2 of this Article, and that they are employed exclusively by companies, subsidiaries or branches.</p><p>The residence and work permits of such employees shall only cover the period of such employment.</p><p>2. Key personnel of the abovementioned companies herein referred to as &#039;organisations` are &#039;intracorporate transferees` as defined in (c) of this paragraph in the following categories, provided that the organisation is a juridical person and that the persons concerned have been employed by it or have been partners in it (other than as majority shareholders), for at least the year immediately preceding such movement:</p><p>(a) persons working in a senior position with an organisation, who primarily direct the management of the establishment, receiving general supervision or direction principally from the board of directors or stockholders of the business or their equivalent, including:</p><p>- directing the establishment or a department or sub-division of the establishment,</p><p>- supervising and controlling the work of other supervisory, professional or managerial employees,</p><p>- having the authority personally to recruit and dismiss or recommend recruiting, dismissing or other personnel actions;</p><p>(b) persons working within an organisation who possess uncommon knowledge essential to the establishment&#039;s service, research equipment, techniques or management. The assessment of such knowledge may reflect, apart from knowledge specific to the establishment, a high level of qualification referring to a type of work or trade requiring specific technical knowledge, including membership of an accredited profession;</p><p>(c) an &#039;intracorporate transferee` is defined as a natural person working within an organisation in the territory of a Party, and being temporarily transferred in the context of pursuit of economic activities in the territory of the other Party; the organisation concerned must have its principal place of business in the territory of a Party and the transfer be to an establishment (branch, subsidiary) of that organisation, effectively pursuing like economic activities in the territory of the other Party.</p><p>3. The entry into and the temporary presence within the territory of the Community or Lithuania of Lithuanian and Community nationals respectively shall be permitted, when these representatives of companies are persons working in a senior position, as defined in paragraph 2 (a), within a company, and are responsible for the setting up of a Community subsidiary or branch of a Lithuanian company or of a Lithuanian subsidiary or branch of a Community company in a Community Member State or Lithuania respectively, when:</p><p>- those representatives are not engaged in making direct sales or supplying services, and</p><p>- the company has its principal place of business outside the Community or Lithuania, respectively, and has no other representative, office, branch or subsidiary in that Community Member State or Lithuania respectively.</p><p></p><p>Article 50</p><p>In order to make it easier for the Community nationals and Lithuanian nationals to take up and pursue regulated professional activities in Lithuania and the Community respectively, the Association Council shall examine which steps are necessary to be taken to provide for the mutual recognition of qualifications. It may take all necessary measures to that end.</p><p></p><p>Article 51</p><p>During the transitional period referred to in Article 3, Lithuania may introduce measures which derogate from the provisions of this Chapter as regards the establishment of Community companies and nationals if certain industries:</p><p>- are undergoing restructuring, or</p><p>- are facing serious difficulties, particularly where these entail serious social problems in Lithuania, or</p><p>- face the elimination or a drastic reduction of the total market share held by Lithuanian companies or nationals in a given sector or industry in Lithuania, or</p><p>- are newly emerging industries in Lithuania.</p><p>Such measures:</p><p>- shall cease to apply at the latest on the expiration of the transitional period referred to in Article 3,</p><p>- shall be reasonable and necessary in order to remedy the situation, and</p><p>- shall only relate to establishments in Lithuania to be created after the entry into force of such measures and shall not introduce discrimination concerning the operations of Community companies or nationals already established in Lithuania at the time of introduction of a given measure compared with Lithuanian companies or nationals.</p><p>While devising and applying such measures, Lithuania shall grant whenever possible to Community companies and nationals a preferential treatment, and in no case a treatment less favourable than that accorded to companies or nationals from any third country.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of these measures, Lithuania shall consult the Association Council and shall not put them into effect before a one-month period following the notification of the Association Council of the concrete measures to be introduced by Lithuania, except where the threat of irreparable damage requires the taking of urgent measures in which case Lithuania shall consult the Association Council immediately after their introduction.</p><p>On expiration of the transitional period referred to in Article 3, Lithuania may introduce such measures only with the authorisation of the Association Council and under conditions determined by the latter.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER III SUPPLY OF SERVICES </p><p></p><p>Article 52</p><p>1. The Parties undertake in accordance with the following provisions to take the necessary steps to allow progressively the supply of services by Community or Lithuanian companies or nationals which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.</p><p>2. In step with the liberalisation process mentioned in paragraph 1, and subject to the provisions of Article 56, the Parties shall permit the temporary movement of natural persons providing the service or who are employed by the service provider as key personnel as defined in Article 49(2), including natural persons who are representatives of a Community or Lithuanian company or national and are seeking temporary entry for the purpose of negotiating for the sale of services or entering into agreements to sell services for that service provider, where those representatives will not be engaged in making direct sales to the general public or in supplying services themselves.</p><p>3. At the latest eight years after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Association Council shall take the measures necessary to implement progressively the provisions of paragraph 1. Account shall be taken of the progress achieved by the Parties in the approximation of their laws.</p><p></p><p>Article 53</p><p>1. The Parties shall not take any measures or actions which render the conditions for the supply of services by Community and Lithuanian nationals or companies which are established in a Party other than that of the person for whom the services are intended significantly more restrictive as compared with the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of the Agreement.</p><p>2. If one Party is of the view that measures introduced by the other Party since the signature of the Agreement result in a situation which is significantly more restrictive in respect of supply of services as compared with the situation existing at the date of signature of the Agreement, such first Party may request the other Party to enter into consultations.</p><p></p><p>Article 54</p><p>1. With regard to international maritime transport, the Parties undertake to apply effectively the principle of unrestricted access to the market and traffic on a commercial basis.</p><p>(a) The above provision does not prejudice the rights and obligations arising from the United Nations Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, as applicable to one or other Party to the present Agreement. Non-conference lines will be free to operate in competition with a conference as long as they adhere to the principle of fair competition on a commercial basis.</p><p>(b) The Parties affirm their commitment to a freely competitive environment as being an essential feature of the dry and liquid bulk trade.</p><p>2. In applying the principles of paragraph 1, the Parties shall:</p><p>(a) not apply, as from entry into force of this Agreement, any cargo-sharing provisions of bilateral agreements between any Member State of the Community and the former Soviet Union;</p><p>(b) not introduce cargo-sharing clauses into future bilateral agreements with third countries, other than in those exceptional circumstances where liner shipping companies from one or other Party to the present Agreement would not otherwise have an effective opportunity to ply for trade to and from the third country concerned;</p><p>(c) prohibit cargo-sharing arrangements in future bilateral agreements concerning dry and liquid bulk trade;</p><p>(d) abolish on entry into force of this Agreement all unilateral measures, administrative, technical and other obstacles which could have restrictive or discriminatory effects on the free supply of services in international maritime transport.</p><p>Each Party shall grant, inter alia, no less favourable treatment for the ships operated by nationals or companies of the other Party than that accorded to a Party&#039;s own ships with regard to access to ports open to international trade, the use of infrastructure and auxiliary maritime services of the ports, as well as related fees and charges, customs facilities and the assignment of berths and facilities for loading and unloading.</p><p>3. Nationals and companies of the Community providing international maritime transport services shall be free to provide international sea-river services in the inland waterways of Lithuania and vice versa.</p><p>4. With a view to ensuring the transit of goods through the territory of each Party, the Parties undertake to conclude an agreement as soon as possible and before the end of 1999 on the transit of intermodal traffic through each other&#039;s territory.</p><p>5. With a view to assuring a coordinated development and progressive liberalisation of transport between the Parties, adapted to their reciprocal commercial needs, the conditions of mutual market access and provision of services in transport by road, rail and inland waterways and, if applicable, in air transport shall be dealt with by specific transport agreements where appropriate, negotiated between the Parties after entry into force of this Agreement.</p><p>6. Prior to the conclusion of the agreements referred to in paragraph 5, the Parties shall not take any measures or actions which are more restrictive or discriminatory as compared with the situation existing on the day preceding the day of entry into force of the Agreement.</p><p>7. During the transitional period, Lithuania shall progressively adapt its legislation including administrative, technical and other rules to that of the Community legislation existing at any time in the field of road, rail, inland waterway and air transport in so far as it serves liberalisation purposes and mutual access to markets of the Parties and facilitates the movement of passengers and of goods.</p><p>8. In step with the common progress in the achievement of the objectives of this Chapter, the Association Council shall examine ways of creating the conditions necessary for improving freedom to provide road, rail, inland waterway and air transport services.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER IV GENERAL PROVISIONS </p><p></p><p>Article 55</p><p>1. The provisions of this Title shall be applied subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</p><p>2. They shall not apply to activities which in the territory of either Party are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.</p><p></p><p>Article 56</p><p>For the purpose of this Title nothing in the Agreement shall prevent the Parties from applying their laws and regulations regarding entry and stay, work, labour conditions and establishment of natural persons and supply of services, provided that, in so doing, they do not apply them in a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Party under the terms of a specific provision of the Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Article 57</p><p>Companies which are controlled and exclusively owned by Lithuanian companies or nationals and Community companies or nationals jointly shall also be beneficiaries of the provisions of Chapters II, III and IV of this Title.</p><p></p><p>Article 58</p><p>1. The most-favoured-nation treatment granted in accordance with the provisions of this Title shall not apply to the tax advantages which the Parties are providing or will provide in the future on the basis of agreements to avoid double taxation, or other tax arrangements.</p><p>2. Nothing in this Title shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by the Parties of any measure aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes pursuant to the tax provisions of agreements to avoid double taxation and other tax arrangements, or domestic fiscal legislation.</p><p>3. Nothing in this Title shall be construed to prevent Member States or Lithuania from distinguishing, in the application of the relevant provisions of their fiscal legislation, between taxpayers who are not in identical situations, in particular as regards their place of residence.</p><p></p><p>Article 59</p><p>The provisions of this Title shall be progressively adjusted by the Parties. In formulating recommendations to this effect, the Association Council shall take into account the respective obligations of the Parties under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and in particular of its Article V.</p><p></p><p>Article 60</p><p>The provisions of this Agreement shall not prejudice the application by each Party of any measure necessary to prevent the circumvention of its measures concerning third country access to its market through the provisions of this Agreement.</p><p></p><p>TITLE V PAYMENTS, CAPITAL, COMPETITION AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROVISIONS, APPROXIMATION OF LAWS </p><p></p><p>CHAPTER I CURRENT PAYMENTS AND MOVEMENT OF CAPITAL </p><p></p><p>Article 61</p><p>The Parties undertake to authorise, in freely convertible currency, any payments on the current account of balance of payments to the extent that the transaction underlying the payments concerns movements of goods, services, or persons between the Parties which have been liberalised pursuant to the present Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Article 62</p><p>1. With regard to transactions on the capital account of balance of payments, from entry into force of the Agreement, the Member States and Lithuania respectively shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to direct investments made in companies formed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Title IV, and the liquidation or repatriation of these investments and of any profit stemming therefrom.</p><p>The liquidation or repatriation of investments linked to establishment of Community nationals establishing in Lithuania as self-employed persons pursuant to Chapter II of Title IV shall be liberalised from entry into force of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above provision, complete free movement of capital for all of these investments shall be ensured by the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3.</p><p>2. With regard to transactions on the capital account of balance of payments, from entry into force of this Agreement the Member States and Lithuania respectively shall ensure the free movement of capital relating to portfolio investment. This shall also apply to the free movement of capital relating to credits related to commercial transactions or the provision of services in which a resident of one of the Parties is participating and to financial loans.</p><p>3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Member States, as from the entry into force of the Agreement, and Lithuania as from the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3, shall be introduce any new restrictions on the movement of capital and current payments connected therewith between residents of the Community and Lithuania and shall not make the existing arrangements more restrictive.</p><p>4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not prevent Lithuania from applying restrictions on outward investments by Lithuanian nationals and companies. However, the liquidation or repatriation of investments made in Lithuania and of any profit stemming therefrom shall not be affected. Five years after the entry into force of this Agreement the Parties agree to consult over the maintenance of any such restrictions, taking into account all the relevant monetary, fiscal and financial considerations.</p><p>5. The Parties shall consult each other with a view to facilitating the movement of capital between the Community and Lithuania in order to promote the objective of the present Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Article 63</p><p>1. During the transitional period referred to in Article 3, the Parties shall take measures permitting the creation of the necessary conditions for the further gradual application of Community rules on the free movement of capital.</p><p>2. By the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3, the Association Council shall examine ways of enabling Community rules on the movement of capital to be applied in full.</p><p></p><p>CHAPTER II COMPETITION AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROVISIONS </p><p></p><p>Article 64</p><p>1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of this Agreement, in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Lithuania:</p><p>(i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;</p><p>(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community or of Lithuania as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;</p><p>(iii) any public aid, which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.</p><p>2. Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European Community or, for products covered by the ECSC Treaty, on the basis of corresponding rules of the ECSC Treaty including secondary legislation.</p><p>3. The Association Council shall, by 31 December 1997, adopt by decision the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.</p><p>Until these rules are adopted, the provisions of the Agreement on interpretation and application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the GATT shall be applied as the rules for the implementation of paragraph 1 point (iii) and related parts of paragraph 2.</p><p>4. (a) For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1(iii), the Parties recognise that until 31 December 1999, any public aid granted by Lithuania shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Lithuania shall be regarded as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92(3)(a) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. The Association Council shall, taking into account the economic situation of Lithuania, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of five years.</p><p>(b) Each Party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid, inter alia, by reporting annually to the other Party on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by providing, on request, information on aid schemes. On request by one Party, the other Party shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.</p><p>5. With regard to products referred to in Chapters II and III of Title III:</p><p>- the provision of paragraph 1(iii) does not apply,</p><p>- any practices contrary to paragraph 1(i) should be assessed according to the criteria established by the Community on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular of those established in Council Regulation No 26/1962.</p><p>6. If the Community or Lithuania considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the terms of the first paragraph of this Article, and</p><p>- is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred to in paragraph 3, or</p><p>- in the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to the interests of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its services industry,</p><p>it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Association Council or after 30 working days following referral for such consultation.</p><p>In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1(iii) of this Article, such appropriate measures may, where the GATT applies thereto, only be adopted in conformity with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the GATT and any other relevant instrument negotiated under its auspices which are applicable between the Parties.</p><p>7. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary adopted in conformity with paragraph 3, the Parties shall exchange information taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements of professional and business secrecy.</p><p></p><p>Article 65</p><p>1. The Parties shall endeavour to avoid the imposition of restrictive measures including measures relating to imports for balance of payments purposes. In the event of their introduction, the Party having introduced the same shall present to the other Party, as soon as possible, a time schedule for their removal.</p><p>2. Where one or more Member States or Lithuania is in serious balance of payments difficulties, or under imminent threat thereof, the Community or Lithuania, as the case may be, may, in accordance with the conditions established under the GATT, adopt restrictive measures, including measures relating to imports, which shall be of limited duration and may not go beyond what is necessary to remedy the balance of payments situation. The Community or Lithuania, as the case may be, shall inform the other Party forthwith.</p><p>3. Any restrictive measures shall not apply to transfers related to investments and in particular to the repatriation of amounts invested or reinvested and of any kind of revenues stemming therefrom.</p><p></p><p>Article 66</p><p>With regard to public undertakings, and undertakings to which special or exclusive rights have been granted, the Association Council shall ensure that as from 1 January 1998, the principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, notably Article 90, and the principles of the concluding document of the April 1990 Bonn meeting of the CSCE, notably entrepreneurs&#039; freedom of decision, are upheld.</p><p></p><p>Article 67</p><p>1. Pursuant to the provisions of this Article and of Annex XIX, the Parties confirm the importance that they attach to ensure adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights.</p><p>2. Lithuania shall continue to improve the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights in order to provide, by the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3, for a level of protection similar to that existing in the Community, including effective means of enforcing such rights.</p><p>3. By the end of the transitional period referred to in Article 3, Lithuania shall accede to the multilateral conventions on intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights referred to in paragraph 1 of Annex XVII to which Member States of the Community are parties or which are, de facto, applied by Member States according to the relevant provisions contained in these conventions.</p><p>4. If problems in the area of intellectual, industrial and commercial property affecting trading conditions were to occur, urgent consultations will be undertaken, at the request of either Party, with a view to reaching mutually satisfactory solutions.</p><p></p><p>Article 68</p><p>1.

Trade in textile products listed in Annex I and originating within the Contracting Parties shall be liberalised for the duration of this Agreement under the conditions set out therein.</p><p>2. Subject to the provisions of this or any successive Agreement, the Community undertakes, in respect of the products listed in Annex I, to suspend the application of quantitative import restrictions currently in force and not to introduce new quantitative restrictions.</p><p>Quantitative import restrictions shall be reintroduced in case of denunciation or non-replacement of the present Agreement.</p><p>3. Measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions on the importation into the Community of the products listed in Annex I shall be prohibited for the duration of this Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>1. Exports from Lithuania to the Community of products listed in Annex I and originating in Lithuania shall, at the time of entry into force of this Agreement, be free from quantitative limits. However, quantitative limits may subsequently be introduced under conditions specified in Article 5.</p><p>2. Should quantitative limits be introduced, exports of the textile products made subject to quantitative limits shall be subject to a double-checking system as specified in Protocol A.</p><p>3. As the time of entry into force of this Agreement, exports of products listed in Annex II not subject to quantitative limits shall be subject to the double-checking system referred to in paragraph 2.</p><p>4. Following consultations in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 15, exports of products in Annex I not subject to quantitative limits other than those listed in Annex II may be subject, subsequently to the entry into force of this Agreement, to the double-checking system referred to in paragraph 2 or to a prior surveillance system introduced by the Community.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>1. Imports into the Community of textile products covered by this Agreement shall not be subject to the quantitative limits established under this Agreement, provided that they are declared to be for re-export outside the Community in the same state or after processing, within the framework of the administrative system of control which exists within the Community.</p><p>However, the release for home use of products imported into the Community under the conditions referred to above shall be subject to the production of an export licence issued by the authorities of Lithuania, and to proof of origin in accordance with the provisions of Protocol A.</p><p>2. Where the Community authorities ascertain that imports of textile products have been set off against a quantitative limit established under this Agreement, but that the products have subsequently been re-exported outside the Community, the authorities shall inform the Lithuania authorities within four weeks of the quantities, involved and authorise imports of identical quantities of the same products which shall not be set off against the quantitative limit established under this Agreement for the current or the following year, as appropriate.</p><p>3. The Community and Lithuania recognise the special and differential character of reimports of textile products into the Community after processing in Lithuania as a specific form of industrial and trade cooperation.</p><p>Should quantitative limits be established pursuant to Article 5, provided that they are effected in accordance with the regulations on economic outward processing in force in the Community, these reimports shall not be subject to these quantitative limits if they are subject to the specific arrangements laid down in Protocol C.</p><p></p><p>Article 4</p><p>Should quantitative limits be introduced pursuant to Article 5, the following provisions shall apply:</p><p>1. In any Agreement year advance use of a portion of the quantitative limit established for the following Agreement year is authorised for each category of products up to 5 % of the quantitative limit for the current Agreement year.</p><p>Amounts delivered in advance shall be deducted from the corresponding quantitative limits established for the following Agreement year.</p><p>2. Carry-over to the corresponding quantitative limit for the following Agreement year of the amounts not used during any Agreement year is authorised for each category of products up to 7 % of the quantitative limit for the current Agreement year.</p><p>3. Transfers in respect of categories in group I shall not be made from any category except as follows:</p><p>- transfers between categories 2 and 3 and from category 1 to categories 2 and 3 may be made up to 4 % of the quantitative limits for the category to which the transfer is made,</p><p>- transfers between categories 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 may be made to 4 % of the quantitative limit for the category to which the transfer is made.</p><p>Transfers into any category in groups II, III, IV and V may be made from any category or categories in groups I, II, III, IV and V up to 5 % of the quantitative limit for the category to which the transfer is made.</p><p>4. The table of equivalence applicable to the transfers referred to above is given in Annex I to this Agreement.</p><p>5. The increase in any category of products resulting from the cumulative application of the provisions in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above during an Agreement year shall not exceed the following limits:</p><p>- 13 % for categories of products in group I;</p><p>- 13,5 % for categories of products in groups II, III, IV and V.</p><p>6. Prior notification shall be given by the Lithuanian authorities in the event of recourse to the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above, at least 15 days in advance.</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>1. Exports of textile products listed in Annex I to this Agreement may be made subject to quantitative limits on the conditions laid down in the following paragraphs.</p><p>2. Where the Community finds, under the system of administrative control set up, that the level of imports of products in a given category listed in Annex I originating in Lithuania exceeds, in relation to the preceding year&#039;s total imports into the Community from all sources of products in that category, the following rates:</p><p>- 0,4 % for categories of products in group I,</p><p>- 2,4 % for categories of products in group II,</p><p>- 8 % for categories of products in groups III, IV and V,</p><p>it may request the opening of consultations in accordance with the procedure described in Article 15 of this Agreement, with a view to reaching agreement on an appropriate restraint level for the products in such category.</p><p>3. Pending a mutually satisfactory solution, Lithuania undertakes, from the date of notification of the request for consultations, to suspend or limit at the level indicated by the Community exports of the category of products in question to the Community or to the region or regions of the Community market specified by the Community.</p><p>The Community shall authorise the importation of products of the said category shipped from Lithuania before the date on which the request for consultations was submitted.</p><p>4. Should the Contracting Parties be unable in the course of consultations to reach a satisfactory solution within the period specified in Article 15 the Community shall have the right to introduce a definitive quantitative limit at an annual level not lower than the level resulting from the application of the formula set out in paragraph 2, or 106 % of the level of imports reached during the calendar year preceding that in which imports exceeded the level resulting from the application of the formula set out in paragraph 2 and gave rise to the request for consultations, whichever is the higher.</p><p>The annual level so fixed shall be revised upwards after consultations in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15, with a view to fulfilling the conditions set out in paragraph 2, should the trend of total imports into the Community of the product in question make this necessary.</p><p>5. The annual growth rate for the quantitative limits introduced pursuant to this Article shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocol D.</p><p>6. The provisions of this Article shall not apply where the percentages specified in paragraph 2 have been reached as a result of a fall in total imports into the Community, and not as a result of an increase in exports of products originating in Lithuania.</p><p>7. In the event of the provisions of paragraph 2, 3 or 4 being applied, Lithuania undertakes to issue export licences for products covered by contracts concluded before the introduction of the quantitative limit, up to the volume of the quantitative limit fixed.</p><p>8. Up to the date of communication of the statistics referred to in Article 12(6), the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article shall apply on the basis of the annual statistics previously communicated by the Community.</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>1. In view of ensuring the effective functioning of this Agreement, the Community and Lithuania agree to cooperate fully in order to prevent, to investigate and to take any necessary legal and/or administrative action against circumvention by transhipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning the country or place of origin, falsification of documents, false declaration concerning fibre content, quantities description or classification of merchandise any by whatever other means. Accordingly, Lithuania and the Community agree to establish the necessary legal provisions and administrative procedures permitting effective action to be taken against such circumvention, which shall include the adoption of legally binding corrective measures against exporters and/or importers involved.</p><p>2. Should the Community believe on the basis of information available that the present Agreement is being circumvented, the Community will consult with Lithuania with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. These consultations will be held as early as possible and at the latest within 30 days from the date of request.</p><p>3. Pending the results of the consultation referred to in paragraph 2, Lithuania shall, as a precautionary measure, if so requested by the Community, take all necessary measures to ensure that, where sufficient evidence of circumvention is provided, adjustments of quantitative limits established pursuant to Article 5 liable to be agreed following the consultations referred to in paragraph 2 may be carried out for the quota year in which the request to open consultations in accordance with paragraph 2 was made, or for the following year if the quota for the current year is exhausted.</p><p>4. Should the Parties be unable, in the course of the consultation referred to in paragraph 2 to reach a mutually satisfactory solution, the Community shall have the right:</p><p>(a) where there is sufficient evidence that products originating in Lithuania have been imported in circumvention of the present Agreement, to set off the relevant quantities against the quantitative limits established pursuant to Article 5;</p><p>(b) where sufficient evidence shows that a false declaration concerning fibre content, quantities, description or classification of products originating in Lithuania has occurred, to refuse to import the products in question;</p><p>(c) should it appear that the territory of Lithuania is involved in transhipment or re-routing of products not originating in Lithuania, to introduce quantitative limits against the same products originating in Lithuania if they are not already subject to quantitative limits, or to take any other appropriate measures.</p><p>5. The Parties agree to establish a system of administrative cooperation to prevent and to address effectively all problems arising from circumvention in accordance with the provisions of Protocol A to this Agreement.</p><p></p><p>Article 7</p><p>1. The quantitative limits established pursuant to this Agreement on imports into the Community of textile products of Lithuanian origin will not be broken down by the Community into regional shares.</p><p>2. The Parties shall cooperate in order to prevent sudden and prejudicial changes in traditional trade flows resulting in regional concentration of direct imports into the Community.</p><p>3. Lithuania shall monitor its exports of products under restraint or surveillance into the Community. Should a sudden and prejudicial change in traditional trade flows arise, the Community will be entitled to request consultations in order to find a satisfactory solution to those problems. Such consultations must be held within 15 working days of their being requested by the Community.</p><p>4. Lithuania shall endeavour to ensure that exports of textile products subject to quantitative limits into the Community are spaced out as evenly as possible over the year due account being taken in particular of seasonal factors.</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>In the event of denunciation of this Agreement as provided for in Article 19(3), the quantitative limits established pursuant to this Agreement shall be reduced on a pro rata temporis basis unless the Contracting Parties decide otherwise by common agreement.</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>Lithuanian exports of cottage-industry fabrics woven on hand- or foot-operated looms, garments or other made-up articles obtained manually from such fabrics and of traditional folklore handicraft products shall not be subject to quantitative limits, provided that these products originating in Lithuania meet the conditions laid down in Protocol B.</p><p></p><p>Article 10</p><p>1. Should the Community consider that a textile product covered by this Agreement is being imported into the Community from Lithuania at a price abnormally lower than the normal competitive level and is for this reason causing or threatening to cause serious injury to Community producers of like or directly competing products, it may request consultations pursuant to Article 15, and in that event the following specific provisions shall be applicable.</p><p>2. If following such consultations it is acknowledged by common accord that the situation described in paragraph 1 exists, Lithuania shall take, within the limits of its powers, the necessary steps, notably as regards the price at which the product in question will be sold, to remedy the situation.</p><p>3. In order to determine whether the price of a textile product is abnormally lower than the normal competitive level, it may be compared with:</p><p>- the prices generally charged for like products sold under the ordinary conditions by other exporting countries on the market of the importing country,</p><p>- the prices of like national products at a comparable marketing stage on the market of the importing country,</p><p>- the lowest prices charged by a third country for the same product in the course of ordinary commercial dealings in the three months preceding the request for consultations, and not having led to the adoption of any measure by the Community.</p><p>4. Should the consultations referred to in paragraph 2 fail to lead to an agreement within 30 days of the Community&#039;s request for consultations, the Community may, until these consultations have produced a mutually satisfactory solution, temporarily refuse consignments of the product in question at prices under the conditions referred to in paragraph 1.</p><p>5. In totally exceptional and critical circumstances, where consignments of products are being imported from Lithuania into the Community at prices abnormally lower than the normal competitive level, such as to cause injury which it would be difficult to repair, the Community may temporarily suspend imports of the products concerned pending agreement on a solution in the course of consultations, which shall be opened immediately. The Contracting Parties shall do their utmost to reach a mutually acceptable solution within 10 working days&#039; notice of the opening of such consultations.</p><p>6. Should the Community have recourse to the measures referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, Lithuania may at any time request the opening of consultations to examine the possibility of eliminating or modifying these measures where the causes which made them necessary no longer exist.</p><p></p><p>Article 11</p><p>1. The classification of the products covered by this Agreement is based on the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the Community (herinafter called the &#039;Combined Nomenclature`, or in abbreviated form &#039;CN`) and any amendments thereof.</p><p>Where any decision on classification results in a change of classification practice or a change of category of any product subject to this Agreement the affected products shall follow the trade regime applicable to the practice or category they fall into after such changes.</p><p>Any amendment to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) made in accordance with the procedures in force in the Community concerning categories of products covered by this Agreement or any decision relating to the classification of goods shall not have the effect of reducing quantitative limits introduced pursuant to this Agreement.</p><p>2. The origin of the products covered by this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the rules in force in the Community.</p><p>Any amendment to these rules of origin shall be communicated to Lithuania and shall not have the effect of reducing any quantitative limit established pursuant to this Agreement.</p><p>The procedures for control of the origin of the products referred to above are laid down in Protocol A.</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>1. Lithuania shall supply the Commission with precise statistical information on all export licences issued for categories of textile products subject to the quantitative limits established pursuant to this Agreement, or to a double-checking system expressed in quantities and in terms of value and broken down by Member States of the Community, as well as on all certificates issued by the competent Lithuanian authorities for products referred to in Article 9 and subject to the provisions of Protocol B.</p><p>2. The Community shall likewise transmit to the Lithuanian authorities precise statistical information on import authorisations issued by the Community authorities and import statistics for products covered by the system referred to in Article 5(2).</p><p>3. The information referred to above shall, for all categories of products, be forwarded before the end of the month following the month to which the statistics relate.</p><p>4. On request by the Community, Lithuania shall supply import statistics for all products covered by Annex I.</p><p>5. Should it be found on analysis of the information exchanged, that there are significant discrepancies between the returns for exports and those for imports, consultations may be initiated in accordance with the procedure specified in Article 15 of this Agreement.</p><p>6. For the purpose of applying the provisions of Article 5, the Community undertakes to provide the Lithuanian authorities before 15 April of each year with the preceding year&#039;s statistics on imports of all textile products covered by this Agreement, broken down by supplying country and Community Member State.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>1. Lithuania shall create favourable conditions for imports of textile products originating in the Community listed in Annex I and, where appropriate inter alia, accord to them non-discriminatory treatment as regards the application of quantitative restrictions, and the granting of licences and the allocation of currency needed to pay for such imports. Lithuania will also recommend to its importers to use the possibilities offered by the Community producers of textiles mentioned above while according the highest possible degree of liberalisation to those imports taking into account the development of trade between the Contracting Parties.</p><p>2. Where a need for additional supplies arises and in particular a need leading to the diversification on imports of textile products in Lithuania, Lithuania shall accord non-discriminatory treatment to imports of textile products originating in the Community.</p><p></p><p>Article 14</p><p>1. The Contracting Parties agree to examine the trend of trade in textile products and garments each year, in the framework of the consultations provided for in Article 15 and on the basis of the statistics referred to in Article 12.</p><p>2. If the Community finds that in the cases foreseen in Article 13(2) of this Agreement it is placed in an unfavourable position as compared with a third country, it may request consultations with Lithuania in accordance with the procedure specified in Article 15 with a view to taking appropriate action.</p><p></p><p>Article 15</p><p>1. Save where it is otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the consultation procedures referred to in this Agreement shall be governed by the following provisions:</p><p>- as far as possible consultations shall be held periodically. Specific additional consultations may also be held,</p><p>- any request for consultations shall be notified in writing to the other Contracting Party,</p><p>- where appropriate, the request for consultations shall be followed within a reasonable period and in any case not later than 15 days following the notification by a report setting out the circumstances which, in the opinion of the requesting Party, justify the submission of such a request,</p><p>- the Contracting Parties shall enter into consultations within one month of notification of the request at the latest, with a view to reaching agreement or a mutually acceptable conclusion within one further month at the latest,</p><p>- the period of one month referred to above for the purpose of reaching agreement or a mutually acceptable conclusion may be extended by common accord.</p><p>2. The Community may request consultations in accordance with paragraph 1 when it ascertains that during a particular year of application of the Agreement difficulties arise in the Community or one of its regions due to a sharp and substantial increase, by comparison to the preceding year, in imports of a given category of group I subject to the quantitative limits established pursuant to this Agreement.</p><p>3. At the request of either of the Contracting Parties, consultations shall be held on any problems arising from the application of this Agreement. Any consultations held pursuant to this Article shall take place in a spirit of cooperation and with a desire to reconcile the differences between the Contracting Parties.</p><p></p><p>Article 16</p><p>The Contracting Parties undertake to promote the exchange of visits by persons, groups and delegations from business, trade and industry, to facilitate contacts in the industrial, commercial and technical fields connected with trade and cooperation in textile industry and textile products and garments, and to assist in the organisation of fairs and exhibitions of mutual interest.</p><p></p><p>Article 17</p><p>As regards intellectual property, at the request of either Contracting Party, consultations shall be held in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15 with a view to finding an equitable solution to problems relating to the protection of marks, designs or models of articles of apparel and textile products.</p><p></p><p>Article 18</p><p>This Agreement shall apply, on the one hand, to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and under the conditions laid down in that Treaty and, on the other hand, to the territory of the Republic of Lithuania.</p><p></p><p>Article 19</p><p>1. This Agreement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties notify each other of the completion of the procedures necessary for that purpose. It shall be applicable until 31 December 1997.</p><p>2. This Agreement shall apply with effect from 1 January 1993.</p><p>3. Either Contracting Party may at any time propose modifications to this Agreement or denounce it, provided that at least six months&#039;s notice is given. In that event, the Agreement shall come to an end on the expiry of the period of notice.</p><p>4. The Contracting Parties agree to enter into consultations not later than six months before the expiration of the present Agreement with a view to possibly concluding a new Agreement.</p><p>5. The Annexes, Protocols, Agreed Minutes and letters exchanged or attached to this Agreement, shall form an integral part thereof.</p><p></p><p>Article 20</p><p>This Agreement shall be drawn up in two copies in the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Lithuanian languages, each of these texts being equally authentic.</p><p></p><p>For the Government of the Republic of Lithuania</p><p>For the Council of the European Communities</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>ANNEX I </p><p></p><p>PRODUCTS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 1 </p><p>1.

Where there is an &#039;ex` symbol in front of a CN code, the products covered in each category are determined by the scope of the CN code and by that of the corresponding description.</p><p>2. Garments which are not recognisable as being garments for men or boys or as being garments for women or girls are classified with the latter.</p><p>3.

The competent authorities of the Community undertake to inform Lithuania of any changes in the Combined Nomenclature (CN) before the date of their entry into force in the Community.</p><p>2. The competent authorities of the Community undertake to inform the competent authorities of Lithuania of any decisions relating to the classification of products subject to the present Agreement, within one month of their adoption at the latest. Such communication shall include:</p><p>(a) a description of the products concerned;</p><p>(b) the relevant category and the related CN codes;</p><p>(c) the reasons which have led to the decision.</p><p>3. Where a decision on classification results in a change of classification practice or a change of category of any product subject to the Agreement, the competent authorities of the Community shall provide 30 days&#039; notice, from the date of the Community&#039;s communication, before the decision is put into effect. Products shipped before the date of entry into effect of the decision shall remain subject to the earlier classification practice, provided that the goods in question are presented for importation into the Community within 60 days of that date.</p><p>4. Where a Community decision on classification resulting in a change of classification practice or a change of categorisation of any product subject to the Agreement affects a category subject to quantitative limits, the Contracting Parties agree to enter into consultation in accordance with the procedures described in Article 15 of the Agreement with a view to honouring the obligation under the second subparagraph of Article 11(1) of the Agreement.</p><p>5. In case of divergent opinions between Lithuania and the competent Community authorities at the point of entry into the Community on the classification of products covered by the present Agreement, classification shall provisionally be based on indications provided by the Community, pending consultations in accordance with Article 15 with a view to reaching agreement on definitive classification of the products concerned.</p><p></p><p>TITLE II ORIGIN </p><p></p><p>Article 2</p><p>1. Products originating in Lithuania for export to the Community in accordance with the arrangements established by this Agreement shall be accompanied by a certificate of Lithuanian origin conforming to the model annexed to this Protocol.</p><p>2. The certificate of origin shall be certified by the competent Lithuanian organisations authorised under the Lithuanian legislation if the products in question can be considered products originating in that country within the meaning of the relevant rules in force in the Community.</p><p>3.

Where quantitative limits have been introduced pursuant to this Agreement, each export licence must certify, inter alia, that the quantity of the product in question has been set off against the quantitative limit established for the category of the products concerned and shall only cover one category of products subject to quantitative limits. It may be used for one or more consignments of the products in question.</p><p>3. For products subject to a double-checking system without quantitative limits the export licence shall conform to model 2 annexed to this Protocol.

Subsequent verification of certificates of origin or export licences shall be carried out at random, or whenever the competent Community authorities have reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of the certificate or licence or as to the accuracy of the information regarding the true origin of the products in question.</p><p>2. In such cases, the competent authorities in the Community shall return the certificate of origin or the export licence or a copy thereof to the competent Lithuanian authorities, giving, where appropriate, the reasons of form or substance which justify an enquiry. If the invoice has been submitted, such invoice or a copy thereof shall be attached to the certificate or to the licence or their copies. The authorities shall also forward any information that has been obtained suggesting that the particulars given on the said certificate or licence are inaccurate.</p><p>3. The provisions of paragraph 1 above shall also apply to subsequent verifications of the declarations of origin provided for in Article 2 of this Protocol.</p><p>4. The results of the subsequent verifications carried out in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the Community within three months at the latest. The information communicated shall indicate whether the disputed certificate, licence or declaration, applies to the goods actually exported and whether these goods are eligible for export under the arrangements established by the Agreement. The information shall also include, at the request of the Community, copies of all documentation necessary to fully determine the facts, and in particular, the true origin of the goods.</p><p>Should such verifications reveal systematic irregularities in the use of declarations of origin, the Community may subject imports of the products in question to the provisions of Article 2(1) of this Protocol.</p><p>5. For the purpose of subsequent verification of certificates of origin, copies of the certificates as well as any export documents referring to them shall be kept for at least two years by the competent Lithuanian authorities.</p><p>6.

To this end, the competent authorities of Lithuania shall, on their own initiative or at the request of the Community, carry out appropriate inquiries, or arrange for such inquiries to be carried out, concerning operations which are, or appear to the Community to be, in circumvention or infringement of this Protocol. Lithuania shall communicate the results of these inquiries to the Community, including any other pertinent information enabling the cause of the circumvention or infringement, including the true origin of the goods, to be determined.</p><p>3. By agreement between the Community and Lithuania, officials designated by the Community may be present at the inquiries referred to in paragraph 2.</p><p>4. Pursuant to the cooperation referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the Community and Lithuania shall exchange any information considered by either Contracting Party to be of use in preventing circumvention or infringement of the provisions of this Agreement. These exchanges may include information on the production of textile products in Lithuania and on the trade in the type of products covered by this Agreement between Lithuania and third countries, particularly where the Community has reasonable grounds to consider that the products in question may be in transit across the territory of Lithuania prior to their importation into the Community. This information may include at the request of the Community, copies of all available relevant documentation.</p><p>5. Where sufficient evidence shows that the provisions of this Protocol have been circumvented or infringed, the competent authorities of Lithuania and the Community may agree to take the measures set out in Article 6(4) of the Agreement, and any other measures as are necessary to prevent a recurrence of such circumvention or infringement.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Annex to Protocol A, Article 2(1) </p><p>&gt;START OF GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>&gt;END OF GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Annex to Protocol A, Article 7(1): Model 1 </p><p>&gt;START OF GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>&gt;END OF GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Annex to Protocol A, Article 7(3): Model 2 </p><p>&gt;START OF GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p>&gt;END OF GRAPHIC&gt;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Protocol B referred to in Article 9</p><p></p><p>Cottage industry and folklore products originating in Lithuania </p><p>1.

The certificates concerning the products envisaged in (c) above must bear a stamp &#039;FOLKLORE` marked clearly. In the case of a difference of opinion between the Parties concerning the nature of these products, consultations shall be held within one month in order to resolve these differences.</p><p>Should imports of any product covered by this Protocol reach proportions liable to cause problems within the Community, consultations with Lithuania shall be initiated as soon as possible, with a view to resolving the situation by the adoption if necessary of a quantitative limit, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15 of this Agreement.</p><p>2.

Reimports not covered by the Annex to this Protocol may be made subject to specific quantitative limits following consultations in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 15 of the Agreement, provided the products concerned are subject to quantitative limits pursuant to the Agreement, to a double-checking system or to surveillance measures.</p><p>3. Having regard to the interests of both Parties, the Community may at its discretion, or in response to a request pursuant to Article 15 of the Agreement:</p><p>(a) examine the possibility of transferring from one category to another, using in advance or carrying over from one year to the next, portions of specific quantitative limits;</p><p>(b) consider the possibility of increasing specific quantitative limits.</p><p>4.

For the purposes of this Article, identical rules of origin to those in this Protocol shall be applied in trade between the Community and Latvia and Estonia and between Lithuania and those two countries and also between each of these three countries themselves.</p><p></p><p>Article 5</p><p>Wholly obtained products</p><p>1.

For the purposes of Article 2, non-originating materials are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the product obtained is classified in a heading which is different from that in which all the non-originating materials used in its manufacture are classified, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3.</p><p>2. For a product mentioned in columns 1 and 2 of the list in Annex II, the conditions set out in column 3 for the product concerned must be fulfilled instead of the rule in paragraph 1.</p><p>Where in the list in Annex II a percentage rule is applied in determining the originating status of a product obtained in the Community or in Lithuania the value-added by the working or processing shall correspond to the ex-works price of the product obtained, less the value of third-country materials imported into the Community or Lithuania.</p><p>3. These conditions indicate, for all products covered by this Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of these products, and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list for that product, is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.</p><p></p><p>Article 7</p><p>Insufficient working or processing operations</p><p>For the purpose of implementing Article 6 the following shall be considered as insufficient working or processing to confer the status of originating products, whether or not there is a change of heading:</p><p>(a) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (ventilation, spreading out, drying, chilling, placing in salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, removal of damaged parts, and like operations);</p><p>(b) simple operations consisting of removal of dust, sifting or screening, sorting, classifying, matching (including the making-up of sets of articles), washing, painting, cutting up;</p><p>(c) (i) changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages;</p><p>(ii) simple placing in bottles, flasks, bags, cases, boxes, fixing on cards or boards, etc., and all other simple packaging operations;</p><p>(d) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging;</p><p>(e) simple mixing of products, whether or not of different kinds, where one or more components of the mixture do not meet the conditions laid down in this Protocol to enable them to be considered as originating in the Community or in Lithuania;</p><p>(f) simple assembly of parts to constitute a complete product;</p><p>(g) a combination of two or more operations specified in subparagraphs (a) to (f);</p><p>(h) slaughter of animals.</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>Unit of qualification</p><p>1. The unit of qualification for the application of the provisions of this Protocol shall be the particular product which is considered as the basic unit when determining classification using the nomenclature of the Harmonised System.</p><p>Accordingly, it follows that:</p><p>(a) when a product composed of a group or assembly of articles is classified under the terms of the Harmonised System in a single heading, the whole constitutes the unit of qualification;</p><p>(b) when a consignment consists of a number of identical products classified under the same heading of the Harmonised System, each product must be taken individually when applying the provisions of this Protocol.</p><p>2. Where, under general rule 5 of the Harmonised System, packaging is included with the product for classification purposes, it shall be included for the purposes of determining origin.</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>Accessories, spare parts and tools</p><p>Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle, which are part of the normal equipment and included in the price thereof or which are not separately invoiced, shall be regarded as one with the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle in question.</p><p></p><p>Article 10</p><p>Sets</p><p>Sets, as defined in general rule 3 of the harmonised System, shall be regarded as originating when all component products are originating. Nevertheless, when a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.</p><p></p><p>Article 11</p><p>Neutral elements</p><p>In order to determine whether a product originates in the Community or in Lithuania, it shall not be necessary to establish whether the electrical energy, fuel, plant and equipment as well as machines and tools used to obtain such product, or whether any goods, used in the course of production which do not enter and which were not intended to enter into the final composition of the product, are originating or not.</p><p></p><p>TITLE III TERRITORIAL REQUIREMENTS </p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Principle of territoriality</p><p>The conditions set out in Title II relative to the acquisition of originating status must be fulfilled without interruption in the Community or in Lithuania without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 3 or 4.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>Reimportation of goods</p><p>If originating products exported from the Community or Lithuania to another country are returned, except in so far as provided for in Articles 3 or 4 they must be considered as non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:</p><p>(a) the goods returned are the same goods as those exported; and</p><p>(b) they have not undergone any operation beyond that necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.</p><p></p><p>Article 14</p><p>Direct transport</p><p>1.

Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 have been fulfilled may be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of:</p><p>(a) a through bill of lading issued in the exporting country covering the passage through the country of transit, or</p><p>(b) a certificate issued by the customs authorities of the country of transit:</p><p>(i) giving an exact description of the products,</p><p>(ii) stating the dates of unloading and reloading of the products and, where applicable, the names of the ships used, and</p><p>(iii) certifying the conditions under which the products remained in the transit country, or</p><p>(c) failing these, any substantiating documents.</p><p></p><p>Article 15</p><p>Exhibitions</p><p>1. Products sent from one of the Contracting Parties for exhibition in a third country and sold after the exhibition for importation in another Party shall benefit on importation from the provisions of this Agreement on condition that the products meet the requirements of this Protocol entitling them to be recognised as originating in the Community or in Lithuania and provided that it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:</p><p>(a) an exporter has consigned these products from one of the Contracting Parties to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there;</p><p>(b) the products have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a person in another Contracting Party;</p><p>(c) the products have been consigned during the exhibition or immediately thereafter to the latter Contracting Party in the state in which they were sent for exhibition; and</p><p>(d) the products have not, since they were consigned for exhibition, been used for any purpose other than demonstration at the exhibition.</p><p>2.

In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.</p><p>7. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in the part of the certificate reserved for the customs authorities.</p><p>8. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting State when the products to which it relates are exported. It shall be made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.</p><p></p><p>Article 18</p><p>Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively</p><p>1.

Furthermore, the total value of these products must not exceed ECU 300 in the case of small packages or ECU 800 in the case of products forming part of travellers&#039; personal luggage.</p><p></p><p>Article 27</p><p>Discrepancies and formal errors</p><p>1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in a movement certificate EUR.1 or in a form EUR.2 and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the movement certificate EUR.1, or the form EUR.2 null and void if it is duly established that this document does correspond to the products submitted.</p><p>2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a movement certificate EUR.1, or a form EUR.2 should not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.</p><p></p><p>Article 28</p><p>Amounts expressed in ecus</p><p>1.

Subsequent verification of movement certificates EUR.1 and forms EUR.2 shall be carried out randomly or whenever the customs authorities of the importing State have reason to doubt the authenticity of such documents, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Protocol.</p><p>2. For the purposes of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the customs authorities of the importing State shall return the movement certificate EUR.1, the form EUR.2, or a copy of these documents, to the customs authorities of the exporting State giving, where appropriate, the reasons of substance or form for an inquiry.</p><p>3. The verification shall be carried out by the customs authorities of the exporting State. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter&#039;s accounts or any other check which they consider appropriate.</p><p>4. If the customs authorities of the importing State decide to suspend the granting of preferential treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, they shall offer to release the products to the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary.</p><p>5. The customs authorities requesting the verification shall be informed of the results of this verification within a maximum of 10 months. These results must indicate clearly whether the documents are authentic and whether the products concerned can be considered as originating products and fulfil the other requirements of this Protocol.</p><p>6. If in cases of reasonable doubt there is no reply within 10 months or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the document in question or the real origin of the products, the requesting customs authorities shall, except in the case of force majeure or in exceptional circumstances, refuse entitlement to the preferences.</p><p></p><p>Article 31</p><p>Dispute settlement</p><p>Where disputes arise in relation to the verification procedures of Article 30 which cannot be settled between the customs authorities requesting a verification and the customs authorities responsible for carrying out this verification or where they raise a question as to the interpretation of this Protocol, they shall be submitted to the Association Council.</p><p>In all cases the settlement of disputes between the importer and the customs authorities of the importing State shall be under the legislation of the said State.</p><p></p><p>Article 32</p><p>Penalties</p><p>Penalties shall be imposed on any person who draws up, or causes to be drawn up, a document which contains incorrect information for the purpose of obtaining a preferential treatment for products.</p><p></p><p>Article 33</p><p>Free zones</p><p>1. The Member States and Lithuania shall take all necessary steps to ensure that products traded under cover of a movement certificate EUR.1, which in the course of transport use a free zone situated in their territory, are not substituted by other goods and that they do not undergo handling other than normal operations designed to prevent their deterioration.</p><p>2. By means of an exemption to the provisions contained in paragraph 1, when products originating in the Community or in Lithuania and imported into a free zone under cover of an EUR.1 certificate and undergo treatment or processing, the authorities concerned must issue a new EUR.1 certificate at the exporter&#039;s request, if the treatment or processing undergone is in conformity with the provisions of this Protocol.</p><p></p><p>TITLE VI CEUTA AND MELILLA </p><p></p><p>Article 34</p><p>Application of the Protocol</p><p>1.

The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number, or the chapter number, used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in column 3. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an &#039;ex`, this signifies that the rule in column 3 only applies to the part of that heading or chapter as described in column 2.</p><p>1.2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of product in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rule in column 3 applies to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified within headings of the chapter or within any of the headings grouped together in column 1.</p><p>1.3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rule in column 3.</p><p></p><p>Note 2 </p><p>2.1. In the case of any heading not in the list or any part of a heading that is not in the list, the &#039;change of heading` rule set out in Article 6(1) applies. If a &#039;change of heading` condition applies to any entry in the list, then it is contained in the rule in column 3.</p><p>2.2. The working or processing required by a rule in column 3 has to be carried out only in relation to the non-originating materials used. The restrictions contained in a rule in column 3 likewise apply only to the non-originating materials used.</p><p>2.3. Where a rule states that &#039;materials of any heading` may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule. However, the expression &#039;manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No . . .` means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used.</p><p>2.4. If a product made from non-originating materials which has acquired originating status during manufacture by virtue of the change of heading rule or its own list rule is used as a material in the process of manufacture of another product, then the rule applicable to the product in which it is incorporated does not apply to it.</p><p>For example:</p><p>An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from &#039;other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging` of heading No 7224.</p><p>If this forging has been forged in the country concerned from a non-originating ingot then the forging has already acquired origin by virtue of the rule for heading No ex 7224 in the list. It can then count as originating in the value calculation for the engine regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or another. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.</p><p>2.5. Even if the change of heading rule or the other rules contained in the list are satisfied, a product shall not acquire originating status if the processing carried out, taken as a whole, is insufficient within the meaning of Article 7.</p><p></p><p>Note 3 </p><p>3.1. The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required and the carrying out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying out of less working or processing cannot confer origin. Thus if a rule says that non-originating material at a certain level of manufacture may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed and the use of such material at a later stage is not.</p><p>3.2. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.</p><p>For example:</p><p>The rule for fabrics say that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; one can use one or the other or both.</p><p>If, however, a restriction applies to one material and other restrictions apply to other materials in the same rule, then the restrictions only apply to the materials actually used.</p><p>For example:</p><p>The rule for sewing machines specifies that both the thread tension mechanism used and the zigzag mechanism used must originate; these two restrictions only apply if the mechanisms concerned are actually incorporated into the sewing machine.</p><p>3.3. When a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule.</p><p>For example:</p><p>The rule for heading No 1904 which specifically excludes the use of cereals or their derivatives does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not produced from cereals.</p><p>For example:</p><p>In the case of an article made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth - even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn - that is the fibre stage.</p><p>See also Note 6.3 in relation to textiles.</p><p>TEXT CONTINUED UNDER DOC.NUM: 298A0220(01).3</p><p>3.4. If in a rule in the list two or more percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. The maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the highest of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded in relation to the particular materials they apply to.</p><p></p><p>Note 4 </p><p>4.1. The term &#039;natural fibres` is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres and is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, the term &#039;natural fibres` includes fibres that have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but not spun.</p><p>4.2. The term &#039;natural fibres` includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305.</p><p>4.3. The terms &#039;textile pulp`, &#039;chemical materials` and &#039;paper-making materials` are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.</p><p>4.4. The term &#039;man-made staple fibres` is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings Nos 5501 to 5507.</p><p></p><p>Note 5 </p><p>5.1. In the case of the products classified within those headings in the list to which a reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 of the list shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in their manufacture which, taken together, represent 10 % or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (but see also Notes 5.3 and 5.4 below).</p><p>5.2. However, this tolerance may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.</p><p>The following are the basic textile materials:</p><p>- silk,</p><p>- wool,</p><p>- coarse animal hair,</p><p>- fine animal hair,</p><p>- horsehair,</p><p>- cotton,</p><p>- paper-making materials and paper,</p><p>- flax,</p><p>- true hemp,</p><p>- jute and other textile bast fibres,</p><p>- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,</p><p>- coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,</p><p>- synthetic man-made filaments,</p><p>- artificial man-made filaments,</p><p>- synthetic man-made staple fibres,</p><p>- artificial man-made staple fibres.</p><p>For example:</p><p>A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the yarn.</p><p>For example:</p><p>A woollen fabric of heading No 5112 made from woollen yarn of heading No 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading No 5509 is a mixed fabric. Therefore synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) or woollen yarn that does not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning) or a combination of the two may be used up to a weight of 10 % of the fabric.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.</p><p>For example:</p><p>If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product.</p><p>For example:</p><p>A carpet with tufts made from both artificial yarns and cotton yarns and with a jute backing is a mixed product because three basic textile materials are used. Thus, any non-originating materials that are at a later stage of manufacture than the rule allows may be used, provided their total weight taken together does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the textile materials in the carpet. Thus, both the jute backing and/or the artificial yarns could be imported at that stage of manufacture, provided the weight conditions are met.</p><p>5.3. In the case of fabrics incorporating &#039;yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped` this tolerance is 20 % in respect of this yarn.</p><p>5.4. In the case of fabrics incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of an adhesive between two films of plastic film, this tolerance is 30 % in respect of this strip.</p><p></p><p>Note 6 </p><p>6.1. In the case of those textile products which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this note, textile materials with the exception of linings and interlinings which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the ex-works price of the product.</p><p>6.2. Materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely, whether or not they contain textiles.</p><p>Example:</p><p>If a rule in the list provides that for a particular textile item, such as trousers, yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.</p><p>6.3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of trimmings and accessories must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.</p><p></p><p>Note 7 </p><p>7.1. For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the &#039;specific processes` are the following:</p><p>(a) vacuum distillation;</p><p>(b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process (1);</p><p>(c) cracking;</p><p>(d) reforming;</p><p>(e) extraction by means of selective solvents;</p><p>(f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolorisation and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;</p><p>(g) polymerisation;</p><p>(h) alkylation;</p><p>(i) isomerisation.</p><p>7.2.

1</p><p>Definitions</p><p>For the purposes of this Protocol:</p><p>(a) &#039;customs legislation` shall mean provisions adopted by the Community and Lithuania, governing the import, export, transit of

2</p><p>Scope</p><p>1. The Parties shall assist each other, within their competences, in the manner and under the conditions laid down in this Protocol, in ensuring that customs legislation is correctly applied, in particular by the prevention, detection and investigation of contraventions of this legislation.</p><p>2. Assistance in customs matters, as provided for in this Protocol, applies to any administrative authority of the Parties which is competent for the application of this Protocol. It shall not prejudice the rules governing mutual assistance in criminal matters. Nor shall it cover information obtained under powers exercised at the request of the judicial authority, unless those authorities so agree.</p><p></p><p>Article 3</p><p>Assistance on request</p><p>1. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall furnish it with all relevant information to enable it to ensure that customs legislation is correctly applied, including information regarding operations noted or planned which contravene or would contravene such legislation.</p><p>2. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall inform it whether goods exported from the territory of one of the Parties have been properly imported into the territory of the other Party, specifying, where appropriate, the customs procedure applied to the goods.</p><p>3.

In such a case Article 6(3) is applicable.</p><p></p><p>Article 6</p><p>Form and substance of requests for assistance</p><p>1. Requests pursuant to this Protocol shall be made in writing. Documents necessary for the execution of such requests shall accompany the request. When required because of the urgency of the situation, oral requests may be accepted, but must be confirmed in writing immediately.</p><p>2. Requests pursuant to paragraph 1 shall include the following information:</p><p>(a) the applicant authority making the request;</p><p>(b) the measure requested;</p><p>(c) the object of and the reason for the request;</p><p>(d) the laws, rules and other legal elements involved;</p><p>(e) indications as exact and comprehensive as possible on the natural or legal persons being the target of the investigations;</p><p>(f) a summary of the relevant facts and of the enquiries already carried out, except in cases provided for in Article 5.</p><p>3. Requests shall be submitted in an official language of the requested authority or in a language acceptable to such authority.</p><p>4. If a request does not meet the formal requirements, its correction or completion may be demanded; the ordering of precautionary measures may, however, take place.</p><p></p><p>Article 7</p><p>Execution of requests</p><p>1. In order to comply with a request for assistance, the requested authority or, when the latter cannot act on its own, the administrative department to which the request has been addressed by this authority, shall proceed, within its competence and available resources, as though it were acting on its own account or at the request of other authorities of that same Party, by supplying information already possessed, by carrying out appropriate enquiries or by arranging for them to be carried out.</p><p>2. Requests for assistance will be executed in accordance with the laws, rules and other legal instruments of the requested Party.</p><p>3. Duly authorised officials of one of the Parties may, with the agreement of the other Party involved and within the conditions laid down by the latter, obtain from the offices of the requested authority or other authority for which the requested authority is responsible, information relating to the contravention of customs legislation which the applicant authority needs for the purposes of this Protocol.</p><p>4. Officials of one of the Parties may, with the agreement of the other Party involved and within the conditions laid down by the latter, be present at enquiries carried out in the latter&#039;s territory.</p><p></p><p>Article 8</p><p>Form in which information is to be communicated</p><p>1. The requested authority shall communicate results of enquiries to the applicant authority in the form of documents, certified copies of documents, reports and the like.</p><p>2. The documents provided for in paragraph 1 may be replaced by computerised information produced in any form for the same purpose.</p><p></p><p>Article 9</p><p>Exceptions to the obligation to provide assistance</p><p>1. The Parties may refuse to give assistance as provided for in this Protocol, where to do so would:</p><p>(a) be likely to prejudice sovereignty, public policy, security or other essential interests; or</p><p>(b) involve currency or tax regulations other than regulations concerning customs duties; or</p><p>(c) violate an industrial, commercial or professional secret.</p><p>2. Where the applicant authority asks for assistance which it would itself be unable to provide if so asked, it shall draw attention to that fact in its request. It shall then be left to the requested authority to decide how to respond to such a request.</p><p>3. If assistance is withheld or denied, the decision and the reasons therefor must be notified to the applicant authority without delay.</p><p></p><p>Article 10</p><p>Obligation to observe confidentiality</p><p>1. Any information communicated in whatsoever form pursuant to this Protocol shall be of a confidential nature. It shall be covered by the obligation of official secrecy and shall enjoy the protection extended to like information under the relevant legislation of the Party which received it and the corresponding provisions applying to the Community authorities.</p><p>2. Nominative data shall not be transmitted whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe that the transfer or the use made of the data transmitted would be contrary to the basic legal principles of one of the Parties, and, in particular, if the person concerned would suffer undue disadvantages. On request, the receiving Party shall inform the furnishing Party of the use made of the information supplied and of the results achieved.</p><p>3. Nominative data may only be transmitted to customs authorities and, in the case of need for prosecution purposes, to public prosecution and judicial authorities. Other persons or authorities may obtain such information only upon previous authorisation by the furnishing authority.</p><p>4. The furnishing Party shall verify the accuracy of the information to be transferred. Whenever it appears that the information supplied was inaccurate or to be deleted, the receiving Party shall be notified without delay. The latter shall be obliged to carry out the correction or deletion.</p><p>5. Without prejudice to cases of prevailing public interest, the person concerned may obtain, on request, information on the data stores and the purpose of this storage.</p><p></p><p>Article 11</p><p>Use of information</p><p>1. Information obtained shall be used solely for the purposes of this Protocol and may be used within each Party for other purposes only with the prior written consent of the administrative authority which furnished the information and shall be subject to any restrictions laid down by that authority. These provisions are not applicable when the information obtained for the purposes of this Protocol could also be used for the purposes of fighting against illicit traffic related to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Such information may be communicated to other authorities directly involved in the combating of illicit drug traffic, within the limits of Article 2.</p><p>2. Paragraph 1 shall not impede the use of information in any judicial or administrative proceedings subsequently instituted for failure to comply with customs legislation.</p><p>3. The Parties may, in their records of evidence, reports and testimonies and in proceedings and charges brought before the courts, use as evidence information obtained and documents consulted in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol.</p><p></p><p>Article 12</p><p>Experts and witnesses</p><p>An official of a requested authority may be authorised to appear, within the limitations of the authorisation granted, as expert or witness in judicial or administrative proceedings regarding the matters covered by this Protocol in the jurisdiction of the other Party, and produce such objects, documents or authenticated copies thereof, as may be needed for the proceedings. The request for an appearance must indicate specifically on what matters and by virtue of what title or qualification the official will be questioned.</p><p></p><p>Article 13</p><p>Assistance expenses</p><p>The Parties shall waive all claims on each other for the reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to this Protocol, except, as appropriate, for expenses to experts and witnesses and to interpreters and translators who are not dependent on public services.</p><p></p><p>Article 14</p><p>Implementation</p><p>1. The management of this Protocol shall be entrusted to the customs department under the Ministry of Finances of the Republic of Lithuania on the one hand and the competent services of the Commission of the European Communities and, where appropriate, the customs authorities of the Member States of the European Union on the other. They shall decide on all practical measures and arrangements necessary for its application, taking into consideration rules in the field of data protection. They may recommend to the Association Council Committee amendments which they consider be made to this Protocol.</p><p>2. The Parties shall consult each other and subsequently keep each other informed of the detailed rules of implementation which are adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Protocol.</p><p></p><p>Article 15</p><p>Complementarity</p><p>1. This Protocol shall complement and not impede the application of any agreements on mutual assistance which have been concluded or may be concluded between individual or several Member States of the European Union and Lithuania. Nor shall it preclude more extensive mutual assistance granted under such agreements.</p><p>2. Without prejudice to Article 11, these agreements do not prejudice Community provisions governing the communication between the competent services of the Commission and the customs authorities of the Member States of any information obtained in customs matters which could be of Community interest.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>FINAL ACT </p><p>The plenipotentiaries of:</p><p>THE KINGDOM OF
