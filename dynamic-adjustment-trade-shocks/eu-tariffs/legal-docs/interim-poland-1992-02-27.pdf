In  the event of the Community or Poland subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the  difficulties referred to in Article 24 to an administrative procedure having as its purpose the  rapid provision of information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other party.</p><p> 2.    In the cases specified in Articles 23, 24 and 25, before taking the measures provided for  therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) applies, as soon as possible, the Community or  Poland, as the case may be, shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information with a  view to seeking a solution acceptable to the two parties.</p><p> In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning  of the Agreement.</p><p> The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the  subject of periodic consultations within that body, particularly with a view to establishing a  timetable for their abolition as soon as circumstances permit.</p><p> 3.    For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply:</p><p> (a)   As regards Article 24, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that  Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee, which may take any decision  needed to put an end to such difficulties.</p><p> If the Joint Committee or the exporting party has not taken a decision putting an end to the  difficulties or no other satisfactory solution has been reached within 30 days of the matter being  referred, the importing party may adopt the appropriate measures to remedy the problem. These  measures must not exceed the scope of what is necessary to remedy the difficulties which have  arisen.</p><p> (b) As regards Article 23, the Joint Committee shall be informed of the dumping case as soon as the  authorities of the importing party have initiated an investigation.

If it has not  taken such a decision within 30 days of the matter being referred to it, the exporting party may  apply appropriate measures on the exportation of the product concerned.</p><p> (d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior information or  examination, as the case may be, impossible, the Community or Poland whichever is concerned may, in  the situations specified in Articles 23, 24 and 25, apply forthwith the precautionary measures  strictly necessary to deal with the situation.</p><p> Article 28 (EA 34)</p><p></p><p>Protocol 4 lays down rules of  origin, for the application of tariff preferences foreseen in this Agreement.</p><p>Article 29 (EA  35)</p><p></p><p>The Agreement shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports, exports or goods in  transit justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; the protection  of health and life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures of artistic,  historic or archaeological value or the protection of intellectual, industrial and commercial  property or rules relating to gold and silver. Such prohibitions or restrictions shall not,  however, constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between  the Parties.</p><p> Article 30 (EA 36)</p><p></p><p>Protocol 5 lays down the specific provisions to apply to trade  between Poland of the one part and Spain and Portugal of the other part.</p><p> TITLE II</p><p>PAYMENTS, COMPETITION AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROVISIONS</p><p></p><p>Article 31 (EA 59)</p><p></p><p>The Parties  undertake to authorize, in freely convertible currency, any payments on the current account of  balance of payments to the extent that the transaction underlying the payments concern movements of  goods between the Parties which have been liberalized pursuant to the present Agreement.</p><p> Article  32 (EA 62)</p><p></p><p>With reference to the provisions of this Chapter, and notwithstanding the provisions of  Article 34, until a full convertibility of the Polish currency in the meaning of Article VIII of  the International Monetary Fund is introduced, Poland may in exceptional circumstances apply  exchange restrictions connected with the granting or taking up of short and medium-term credits to  the extent that such restrictions are imposed on Poland for the granting of such credits and are  permitted according to Poland&#039;s status under the IMF.</p><p> Poland shall apply these restrictions in a non-discriminatory manner. They shall be applied in such  a manner as to cause the least possible disruption to this Agreement. Poland shall inform the Joint  Committee promptly of the introduction of such measures and of any changes therein.</p><p> Article 33 (EA  63)</p><p></p><p>1.    The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement, in so far  as they may affect trade between the Community and Poland:</p><p> (i)   all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted  practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or  distortion of competition;</p><p> (ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Community  or of Poland as a whole or in a substantial part thereof;</p><p> (iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain  undertakings or the production of certain goods.</p><p> 2.    Any practices contrary to this Article shall be assessed on the basis of criteria arising  from the application of the rules of Articles 85, 86 and 92 of the Treaty establishing the European  Economic Community.</p><p> 3.    The Joint Committee shall, within three years of the entry into force of the Agreement, adopt  by decision the necessary rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2.</p><p> Until these rules are adopted, the provisions of the Agreement on interpretation and application of  Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade shall be applied as the  rules for the implementation of paragraphs 1 (iii) and related parts of paragraph 2.</p><p> 4.   (a)   For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 1, point (iii), the Parties  recognize that during the first five years after the entry into force of the Agreement, any public  aid granted by Poland shall be assessed taking into account the fact that Poland shall be regarded  as an area identical to those areas of the Community described in Article 92.3(a) of the Treaty  establishing the European Economic Community. The Joint Committee shall, taking into account the  economic situation of Poland, decide whether that period should be extended by further periods of  five years.</p><p>  (b) Each party shall ensure transparency in the area of public aid, inter alia by reporting  annually to the other party on the total amount and the distribution of the aid given and by  providing, upon request, information on aid schemes. Upon request by one party, the other party  shall provide information on particular individual cases of public aid.</p><p> 5.    With regard to products referred to in Chapters II and III of Title I:</p><p> -   the provision of paragraph 1 (iii) does not apply,</p><p> - any practices contrary to paragraph 1 (i) should be assessed according to the criteria  established by the Community on the basis of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty establishing the  European Economic Community and in particular of those established in Council Regulation No  26/1962.</p><p> 6.    If the Community or Poland considers that a particular practice is incompatible with the  terms of the first paragraph of this Article, and:</p><p> -   is not adequately dealt with under the implementing rules referred to in paragraph 3, or</p><p>- in  the absence of such rules, and if such practice causes or threatens to cause serious prejudice to  the interest of the other Party or material injury to its domestic industry, including its services  industry,</p><p> it may take appropriate measures after consultation within the Joint Committee or after 30 working  days following referral for such consultation.</p><p> In the case of practices incompatible with paragraph 1  (iii) of this Article, such appropriate  measures may, where the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade applies thereto, only be adopted in  conformity with the procedures and under the conditions laid down by the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade and any other relevant instrument negotiated under its auspices which are  applicable between the Parties.</p><p> 7.    Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary adopted in conformity with paragraph 3, the  parties shall exchange information taking into account the limitations imposed by the requirements  of professional and business secrecy.</p><p> 8.
